   Édouard Manet ( January 23, 1832 – April 30, 1883) was a French
   painter. One of the first nineteenth century artists to approach
   modern-life subjects, he was a pivotal figure in the transition from
   Realism to Impressionism. His early masterworks The Luncheon on the
   Grass and Olympia engendered great controversy, and served as rallying
   points for the young painters who would create Impressionism—today
   these are considered watershed paintings that mark the genesis of
   modern art.

Biography

Early life

   Édouard Manet was born in Paris in 1832 to an affluent and well
   connected family. His mother, Eugénie-Desirée Fournier, was the
   goddaughter of the Swedish crown prince, Charles Bernadotte, from whom
   the current Swedish monarchs are descended. His father, Auguste Manet,
   was a French judge who expected Édouard to pursue a career in law. His
   uncle, Charles Fournier, encouraged him to pursue painting and often
   took young Manet to the Louvre.

   From 1850 to 1856, after failing the examination to join the navy,
   Manet studied under the academic painter Thomas Couture. In his spare
   time he copied the old masters in the Louvre.

   He visited Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, during which time he
   absorbed the influences of the Dutch painter Frans Hals, and the
   Spanish artists Diego Velázquez and Francisco José de Goya.

   In 1856, he opened his own studio. His style in this period was
   characterized by loose brush strokes, simplification of details, and
   the suppression of transitional tones. Adopting the current style of
   realism initiated by Gustave Courbet, he painted The Absinthe Drinker
   (1858-59) and other contemporary subjects such as beggars, singers,
   Gypsies, people in cafés, and bullfights. After his early years, he
   rarely painted religious, mythological, or historical subjects;
   examples include his Christ Mocked, now in the Art Institute of
   Chicago, and Christ with Angels, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New
   York.

Music in the Tuileries

   Music in the Tuileries, 1862
   Music in the Tuileries, 1862

   Music in the Tuileries is an early example of Manet's painterly style,
   inspired by Hals and Velázquez, and it is a harbinger of his life-long
   interest in the subject of leisure.

   While the picture was not regarded as finished by some, the suggested
   atmosphere imparts a sense of what the Tuileries gardens were like at
   the time; one may imagine the music and conversation.

   Here Manet has depicted his friends, artists, authors, and musicians
   who take part, and he has included a self-portrait among the subjects.

Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe)

   The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe), 1863
   The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe), 1863

   A major early work is The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur
   l'herbe). The Paris Salon rejected it for exhibition in 1863, but he
   exhibited it at the Salon des Refusés (Salon of the rejected) later in
   the year. Emperor Napoleon III had initiated The Salon des Refusés,
   after the Paris Salon rejected more than 4,000 paintings in 1863.

   The painting's juxtaposition of fully-dressed men and a nude woman was
   controversial, as was its abbreviated, sketch-like handling—an
   innovation that distinguished Manet from Courbet. At the same time,
   Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the
   disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi's
   engraving Urteil des Paris (c. 1515) after his copy from a drawing by
   Raphael.

   Scholars also cite as an important precedent for Manet's painting Le
   déjeuner sur l'herbe, The Tempest which is a famous Renaissance
   painting by Italian master Giorgione (around 1508). It is housed in the
   Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice, Italy. The mysterious and enigmatic
   painting also features a fully dressed man and a nude female in a rural
   setting. The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side,
   apparently at the woman; a partially nude woman, who is sitting in a
   landscape, and is breastfeeding a baby. While darkening clouds and
   distant lightening herald an approaching storm. The relationship
   between the two figures is unclear.

Olympia

   Olympia, 1863
   Olympia, 1863

   As he had in Luncheon on the Grass, Manet again paraphrased a respected
   work by a Renaissance artist in the painting Olympia ( 1863), a nude
   portrayed in a style reminiscent of early studio photographs, but whose
   pose was based on Titian's Venus of Urbino ( 1538).

   The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some
   small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a
   ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her
   nakedness. This modern Venus' body is thin, counter to prevailing
   standards; thin women were not considered attractive at the time, and
   the painting's lack of idealism rankled. A fully-dressed servant is
   featured, exploiting the same juxtaposition as in Luncheon on the
   Grass.

   Manet's Olympia also was considered shocking because of the manner in
   which the subject acknowledges the viewer. She defiantly looks out as
   her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her
   hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the reference to
   traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously
   absent in this work. The alert black cat at the foot of the bed strikes
   a rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian's
   portrayal of the goddess in his Venus of Urbino. Manet's uniquely frank
   (and largely unpopular) depiction of a self-assured prostitute was
   rejected by the Paris Salon of 1863. At the same time, his notoriety
   translated to popularity in the French avant-garde community.

   As with Luncheon on the Grass, the painting raised the issue of
   prostitution within contemporary France and the roles of women within
   society.

Life and times

   Berthe Morisot, 1872
   Berthe Morisot, 1872

   The roughly painted style and photographic lighting in these works was
   seen as specifically modern, and as a challenge to the Renaissance
   works Manet copied or used as source material. His work is considered
   'early modern', partially because of the black outlining of figures,
   which draws attention to the surface of the picture plane and the
   material quality of paint.

   He became friends with the Impressionists Edgar Degas, Claude Monet,
   Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Paul Cézanne, and Camille
   Pissarro, through another painter, Berthe Morisot, who was a member of
   the group and drew him into their activities. The grand niece of the
   painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Morisot's paintings first had been
   accepted in the Salon de Paris in 1864 and she continued to show in the
   salon for ten years.

   Manet became the friend and colleague of Berthe Morisot in 1868. She is
   credited with convincing Manet to attempt plein air painting, which she
   had been practicing since she had been introduced to it by another
   friend of hers, Camille Corot. They had a reciprocating relationship
   and Manet incorporated some of her techniques into his paintings. In
   1874, she become his sister-in-law when she married his brother,
   Eugene.

   Unlike the core Impressionist group, Manet maintained that modern
   artists should seek to exhibit at the Paris Salon rather than abandon
   it in favour of independent exhibitions. Nevertheless, when Manet was
   excluded from the International exhibition of 1867, he set up his own
   exhibition. His mother worried that he would waste all his inheritance
   on this project, which was enormously expensive. While the exhibition
   earned poor reviews from the major critics, it also provided his first
   contacts with several future Impressionist painters, including Degas.

   Although his own work influenced and anticipated the Impressionist
   style, he resisted involvement in Impressionist exhibitions, partly
   because he did not wish to be seen as the representative of a group
   identity, and partly because he preferred to exhibit at the Salon. Eva
   Gonzalès was his only formal student.

   He was influenced by the Impressionists, especially Monet and Morisot.
   Their influence is seen in Manet's use of lighter colors, but he
   retained his distinctive use of black, uncharacteristic of
   Impressionist painting. He painted many outdoor ( plein air) pieces,
   but always returned to what he considered the serious work of the
   studio.

   Throughout his life, although resisted by art critics, Manet could
   number as his champions Émile Zola, who supported him publicly in the
 RESPONSE: 
  Édouard Manet (1832-1883) was a French painter who played a pivotal role in the transition from Realism to Impressionism. He is considered one of the first nineteenth-century artists to approach modern-life subjects in his work. Manet's early masterpieces, such as "The Luncheon on the Grass" (1863) and "Olympia" (1863), engendered great controversy and served as rallying points for young painters who would create Impressionism.

Manet was born in Paris in 1832 to an affluent and well-connected family. His mother, Eugénie-Desirée Fournier, was the goddaughter of the Swedish crown prince, Charles Bernadotte, from whom the current Swedish monarchs are descended. His father, Auguste Manet, was a French judge who expected Édouard to pursue a career in law. However, Manet's uncle, Charles Fournier, encouraged him to pursue painting and often took young Manet to the Louvre to admire the old masters.

In conclusion, Édouard Manet was a pioneering artist who played a crucial role in the transition from Realism to Impressionism. His innovative style, inspired by Hals and Velázquez, and his willingness to challenge traditional themes and techniques, made him a controversial figure in his time. However, his legacy as a pioneer of modern art is undeniable, and his influence can be seen in the work of many artists who followed in his footsteps.

   The tsunami caused by the December 26, 2004 earthquake strikes Ao Nang,
   Thailand.

   The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, known by the scientific community as
   the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, was an undersea earthquake that
   occurred at 00:58:53 UTC (07:58:53 local time) December 26, 2004 with
   an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The earthquake
   triggered a series of devastating tsunamis that spread throughout the
   Indian Ocean, killing large numbers of people and inundating coastal
   communities across South and Southeast Asia, including parts of
   Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. Although initial estimates
   have put the worldwide death toll at over 275,000 with thousands of
   others missing, recent analysis compiled lists a total of 229,866
   persons lost, including 186,983 dead and 42,883 missing. The figure
   excludes 400 to 600 people who are believed to have perished in Myanmar
   which is more than that government's official figure of only 61 dead.
   The catastrophe is one of the deadliest disasters in modern history.
   The disaster is known in Asia and in the international media as the
   Asian Tsunami, and also called the Boxing Day Tsunami in Australia,
   Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as it took place on Boxing
   Day. Coincidentally, the tsunami occurred exactly one year after the
   2003 earthquake that devastated the southern Iranian city of Bam.

   The magnitude of the earthquake was originally recorded as 9.0 on the
   Richter scale, but has been upgraded to between 9.1 and 9.3. At this
   magnitude, it is the second largest earthquake ever recorded on a
   seismograph. This earthquake was also reported to be the longest
   duration of faulting ever observed, lasting between 500 and 600
   seconds, and it was large enough that it caused the entire planet to
   vibrate at least half an inch, or over a centimetre. It also triggered
   earthquakes in other locations as far away as Alaska.

   The earthquake originated in the Indian Ocean just north of Simeulue
   island, off the western coast of northern Sumatra. The resulting
   tsunami devastated the shores of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand
   and other countries with waves up to 30 m (100 ft). It caused serious
   damage and deaths as far as the east coast of Africa, with the furthest
   recorded death due to the tsunami occurring at Rooi Els in South
   Africa, 8,000 km (5,000 mi) away from the epicentre. In total, eight
   people in South Africa died due to abnormally high sea levels and
   waves.

   The plight of the many affected people and countries prompted a
   widespread humanitarian response. In all, the worldwide community
   donated more than US$7 billion in humanitarian aid to those affected by
   the earthquake.

Earthquake characteristics

   Enlarge
   Epicentre of the earthquake, just north of Simeulue Island

   The earthquake was initially reported as moment magnitude, Mw 9.0.
   (Notice that this is not the so-called Richter scale or local magnitude
   scale, ML, which is known to saturate at higher magnitudes.) In
   February 2005 some scientists revised the estimate of the magnitude to
   9.3. Although the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre has accepted these new
   numbers, the United States Geological Survey has so far not changed its
   estimate of 9.1. The most recent studies in 2006 have obtained a
   magnitude of Mw 9.1 to 9.3. Dr. Hiroo Kanamori of the California
   Institute of Technology believes that Mw = 9.2 is a good representative
   value for the size of this great earthquake. Reference: EERI
   Publication 2006-06, page 14 [www.eeri.org]

   The hypocentre of the main earthquake was at 3.316°N, 95.854°E ( 3°19′N
   95°51.24′E), approximately 160 km (100 mi) west of Sumatra, at a depth
   of 30 km (19 mi) below mean sea level (initially reported as 10 km).
   The earthquake itself (apart from the tsunami) was felt as far away as
   Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore and the
   Maldives.

   Indonesia lies between the Pacific Ring of Fire along the north-eastern
   islands adjacent to and including New Guinea and the Alpide belt along
   the south and west from Sumatra, Java, Bali, Flores, and Timor. The
   December 2004 earthquake actually occurred within the Alpide belt.

   Since 1900 the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude were
   the 1960 Great Chilean Earthquake (magnitude 9.5) and the 1964 Good
   Friday Earthquake in Prince William Sound (9.2). The only other
   recorded earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater was off Kamchatka,
   Russia, on November 4, 1952 (magnitude 9.0). Each of these megathrust
   earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean, but the death
   toll from these was significantly lower. The worst of these caused only
   a few thousand deaths, primarily because of the lower population
   density along the coasts near affected areas and the much greater
   distances to more populated coasts.

   Other very large megathrust earthquakes occurred in 1868 (Peru, Nazca
   Plate and South American Plate); 1827 (Colombia, Nazca Plate and South
   American Plate); 1812 (Venezuela, Caribbean Plate and South American
   Plate) and 1700 ( Cascadia Earthquake, western U.S. and Canada, Juan de
   Fuca Plate and North American Plate). These are all believed to have
   been of greater than magnitude 9, but no accurate measurements were
   available at the time.

Tectonic plates

   The earthquake was unusually large in geographical extent. An estimated
   1,200 km (750 mi) of faultline slipped about 15 m (50 ft) along the
   subduction zone where the India Plate dives under the Burma Plate. The
   slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over a
   period of several minutes. Seismographic and acoustic data indicate
   that the first phase involved the formation of a rupture about 400 km
   (250 mi) long and 100 km (60 mi) wide, located 30 km (19 mi) beneath
   the sea bed—the longest rupture ever known to have been caused by an
   earthquake. The rupture proceeded at a speed of about 2.8 km/s (1.7
   mi/s) or 10,000 km/h (6,300 mph), beginning off the coast of Aceh and
   proceeding north-westerly over a period of about 100 seconds. A pause
   of about another 100 seconds took place before the rupture continued
   northwards towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. However, the
   northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about
   2.1 km/s (1.3  mi/s) or 7,600 km/h (4,700 mph), continuing north for
   another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault changes from
   subduction to strike-slip (the two plates push past one another in
   opposite directions). This reduced the speed of the water displacement
   and so reducing the size of the tsunami that hit the northern part of
   the Indian Ocean.

   The India Plate is part of the great Indo-Australian Plate, which
   underlies the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, and is drifting
   north-east at an average of 6 cm/year (2 inches per year). The India
   Plate meets the Burma Plate (which is considered a portion of the great
   Eurasian Plate) at the Sunda Trench. At this point the India Plate
   subducts beneath the Burma Plate, which carries the Nicobar Islands,
   the Andaman Islands and northern Sumatra. The India Plate slips deeper
   and deeper beneath the Burma Plate until the increasing temperature and
   pressure drive volatiles out of the subducting plate. These volatiles
   rise into the crust above and trigger melt which exits the earth's
   crust through volcanoes in the form of a volcanic arc. The volcanic
   activity that results as the Indo-Australian plate subducts the
   Eurasian plate has created the Sunda Arc.

   As well as the sideways movement between the plates, the sea bed is
   estimated to have risen by several metres, displacing an estimated
   30 km³ (7 cu mi) of water and triggering devastating tsunami waves. The
   waves did not originate from a point source, as mistakenly depicted in
   some illustrations of their spread, but radiated outwards along the
   entire 1,200 km (750 mi) length of the rupture (acting as a line
   source). This greatly increased the geographical area over which the
   waves were observed, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile and the Arctic.
   The raising of the sea bed significantly reduced the capacity of the
   Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the global sea level by an
   estimated 0.1 mm.

 RESPONSE: 
  The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, also known as the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, was a massive undersea earthquake that occurred on December 26, 2004, off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that spread across the Indian Ocean, affecting several countries in Southeast Asia and Africa, and causing widespread devastation and loss of life.

The earthquake occurred at 00:58:53 UTC (07:58:53 local time) and had a magnitude of 9.0 on the Richter scale, making it one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded. The epicenter of the earthquake was located just north of Simeulue island, off the western coast of northern Sumatra. The earthquake caused the entire planet to vibrate for at least half an inch, and it was large enough to cause earthquakes in other locations as far away as Alaska.

The tsunami caused by the earthquake devastated the shores of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, and other countries, with waves up to 30 meters (100 feet) high. The tsunami caused serious damage and deaths as far away as the east coast of Africa, with the furthest recorded death occurring in Rooi Els, South Africa, 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) away from the epicenter.

The earthquake and tsunami prompted a widespread humanitarian response, with over $7 billion in aid donated to those affected by the disaster. The earthquake also caused the India Plate to subduct beneath the Burma Plate, resulting in the formation of a volcanic arc and the raising of the sea bed, which significantly increased the global sea level by an estimated 0.1 mm.

After the initial earthquake, there were numerous aftershocks, with over 400 earthquakes measuring greater than 4.0 on the Richter scale occurring between December 26, 2004, and January 10, 2005. The largest aftershock occurred on January 5, 2005, with a magnitude of 7.7.

In conclusion, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami were a devastating disaster that caused widespread destruction and loss of life across Southeast Asia and Africa. The earthquake was one of the largest in recorded history, and it highlighted the vulnerability of coastal communities to tsunamis and the importance of disaster preparedness and response.

   The 19th century lasted from 1801 through 1900 in the Gregorian
   calendar.

   Historians sometimes define a "Nineteenth Century" historical era
   stretching from 1815 (The Congress of Vienna) to 1914 (The outbreak of
   the First World War); alternatively, Eric Hobsbawm defined the "Long
   Nineteenth Century" as spanning the years 1789 to 1914.

   During this century, the Spanish, Portuguese, and Ottoman empires began
   to crumble and the Holy Roman and Mughal empires ceased.

   Following the Napoleonic Wars, the British Empire became the world's
   leading power, controlling one quarter of the World's population and
   one third of the land area. It enforced a Pax Britannica, encouraged
   trade, and battled rampant piracy.

   Slavery was greatly reduced around the world. Following a successful
   slave revolt in Haiti, Britain forced the Barbary pirates to halt their
   practice of kidnapping and enslaving Europeans, banned slavery
   throughout its domain, and charged its navy with ending the global
   slave trade. Slavery was then abolished in Russia, America, and Brazil
   (see Abolitionism).

   Electricity, steel, and petroleum fueled a Second Industrial Revolution
   which enabled Germany, Japan, and the United States to become Great
   Powers that raced to create empires of their own. However, Russia and
   Qing Dynasty China failed to keep pace with the other world powers
   which led to massive social unrest in both empires.

 RESPONSE: 
  The 19th century was a transformative period in world history, marked by significant political, social, and economic changes. Here are some key events and developments that took place during this century:

1. The French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars (1789-1815): The French Revolution overthrew the monarchy and established the First French Republic. Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power and conquered much of Europe, leading to the Napoleonic Wars.
2. The Industrial Revolution (1800s): The 19th century saw the rapid growth of industry and urbanization, particularly in Britain. New technologies and inventions, such as the steam engine and the railroad, transformed the way goods were produced and transported.
3. The British Empire (1815-1914): The British Empire became the dominant world power during the 19th century, with colonies and territories around the globe. The Empire was marked by the rule of the British monarchy, the expansion of capitalism, and the exploitation of colonies for resources.
4. The abolition of slavery (1800s): Slavery was gradually abolished around the world during the 19th century, with many countries outlawing the practice. The British Empire was a leader in this effort, with the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 banning slavery throughout the empire.
5. The rise of nationalism (1800s): As industrialization and urbanization transformed society, nationalism emerged as a powerful force. Many countries, particularly in Europe, experienced the rise of nationalist movements and the formation of new nations.
6. The Great Power rivalries (1800s): The 19th century saw the emergence of new global powers, including Germany, Japan, and the United States. These powers competed with each other for influence and territory, leading to conflicts such as the Franco-Prussian War and the Russo-Japanese War.
7. The Scramble for Africa (1880s): European powers, particularly Britain and France, began to colonize and exploit Africa during the late 19th century. This period saw the division of Africa among the European powers and the establishment of colonial regimes.
8. The Russian Revolution (1905 and 1917): The Russian Revolution of 1905 and 1917 saw the overthrow of the Russian monarchy and the establishment of the Soviet Union. This revolution had a profound impact on world history, leading to the rise of communism and the Soviet Union as a global superpower.

Overall, the 19th century was a time of significant change and upheaval, marked by the rise of new technologies, the emergence of new global powers, and the transformation of social and political structures around the world.

1973 oil crisis

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Recent History

   The 1973 oil crisis first began on October 17, 1973 when the
   Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OAPEC), consisting
   of the Arab members of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria, announced as a result
   of the ongoing Yom Kippur War, that they would no longer ship petroleum
   to nations that had supported Israel in its conflict with Syria and
   Egypt. This included the United States and its allies in Western
   Europe.

   About the same time, OPEC members agreed to use their leverage over the
   world price-setting mechanism for oil in order to quadruple world oil
   prices, after attempts at negotiation with the " Seven Sisters" earlier
   in the month failed. Due to the dependence of the industrialized world
   on OPEC oil, these price increases were dramatically inflationary to
   the economies of the targeted countries, while at the same time
   suppressive of economic activity. The targeted countries responded with
   a wide variety of new, and mostly permanent, initiatives to contain
   their further dependency.

Origins of the 1973 world oil shock

   The Arab-Israeli conflict triggered an energy crisis in the making.
   Before the embargo, the industrialized West, especially the United
   States, was used to cheap and plentiful petroleum. Post-World War II
   American cities, with expansive suburbs full of detached, single-family
   homes, depended on the automobile as the principal form of
   transportation — a form that consumes oil en masse as fuel. Between
   1945 and the late 1970s, the West and Japan consumed more oil and
   minerals than had been used in all previous recorded history. Oil
   consumption in the U.S. had more than doubled between 1950 and 1974.
   With only 6% of the world's population, the U.S. was consuming 33% of
   the world's energy. At the same time, the U.S. economy accounted for a
   quarter of total global production, meaning U.S. workers were over four
   times more productive than the global average. This was a result of
   their advanced industrial sector, which accounted for over five times
   the global average for energy usage.

   Oil, especially from the Middle East, was paid for in United States
   dollars (aka petrodollars), at prices fixed in dollars. U.S. President
   Richard Nixon presided over an economy in which growth was already
   sluggish, and in which inflation was already troubling. By the summer
   of 1971, Nixon was under strong public pressure to act decisively to
   end the dilemma of rising prices and general economic stagnation (see "
   stagflation"). To allow the value of gold to fall in world markets,
   Nixon ended the convertibility of the US dollar into gold on August 15,
   1971, thereby ending the Bretton Woods system, which had been in place
   since the end of World War II. The U.S. dollar was devalued by 8% in
   relation to gold in December 1971, and devalued again in 1973.

   The devaluation resulted in increased world economic and political
   uncertainty. Concurrently, in the early 1970s, the fall in the U.S.
   dollar went along with a fall in the price of oil (in USD). This
   improved the situation of U.S. industrialists in relation to European
   and Japanese competition. But the de-valorization — and then
   devaluation — of the dollar crystallized the unease of raw materials
   producers in the Third World; they saw the wealth under their lands
   being reduced and their assets growing in a currency that was worth
   significantly less than it had been recently. This set the stage for
   the struggle for control of the world's natural resources and for a
   more favorable sharing of the value of these resources between the rich
   countries and the oil-exporting nations of OPEC .

   OPEC devised a strategy of counter-penetration, whereby it hoped to
   make industrial economies that relied heavily on oil imports vulnerable
   to Third World pressures . Dwindling foreign aid from the U.S. and its
   allies, combined with the West's pro-Israeli stance in the Middle East,
   angered the Arab nations in OPEC.

Founding of OPEC

   OPEC consisted of thirteen nations, including seven Arab countries,
   Iran, and also other major petroleum-exporting countries in the
   developing world like Venezuela. It had been officially announced on
   September 14 in Cairo, 1960 to protest pressure by major oil companies
   (mostly owned by U.S., British, and Dutch nationals) to reduce oil
   prices and payments to producers. At first it had operated as an
   informal bargaining unit for the sale of oil by Third World nations. It
   confined its activities to gaining a larger share of the revenues
   produced by Western oil companies and greater control over the levels
   of production. However, in the early 1970s it began to display its
   strength.

   The persistence of the Arab-Israeli conflict finally triggered a
   response that transformed OPEC from a mere cartel into a formidable
   political force. After the Six Day War of 1967 the Arab members of OPEC
   formed a separate, overlapping group ( Organization of Arab Petroleum
   Exporting Countries) for the purpose of centering policy and exerting
   pressure on the West over its support of Israel. Egypt and Syria,
   though not major oil-exporting countries, joined the latter grouping to
   help articulate its objectives. Later, the Yom Kippur War of 1973
   galvanized Arab opinion. Ostensibly a reaction to the emergency
   re-supply effort that had enabled Israel to withstand Egyptian and
   Syrian forces (while at the same time the Soviets were resupplying the
   Arab forces), the Arab world imposed the 1973 oil embargo against the
   United States, Western Europe, and Japan. It has since come to light
   that an accord regarding the usage of the "oil weapon" was actually
   negotiated before the war by Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Thus by the early
   1970s the great Western oil conglomerates suddenly faced a unified bloc
   of producers.

   As mentioned, the Arab-Israeli conflict triggered a crisis already in
   the making. The West could not continue to increase its energy use 5%
   annually, pay low oil prices, yet sell inflation-priced goods to the
   petroleum producers in the Third World. This was stressed by the Shah
   of Iran, whose nation was the world's second-largest exporter of oil
   and the closest ally of the United States in the Middle East at the
   time. "Of course [the world price of oil] is going to rise," the Shah
   told the New York Times in 1973. "Certainly! And how...; You [Western
   nations] increased the price of wheat you sell us by 300%, and the same
   for sugar and cement...; You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us,
   redefined as petrochemicals, at a hundred times the price you've paid
   to us...; It's only fair that, from now on, you should pay more for
   oil. Let's say ten times more."

Arab oil embargo

   On October 16, 1973, as part of the political strategy that included
   the Yom Kippur War, OAPEC cut production of oil and placed an embargo
   on shipments of crude oil to the West, with the United States and the
   Netherlands specifically targeted. Also imposed was a boycott of
   Israel. Since oil demand is very price inelastic, (i.e., the quantity
   purchased falls little with price rises), prices had to rise
   dramatically to reduce demand to the new, lower level of supply. The
   embargo on oil caused the market price for oil to rise substantially.
   Government price controls, designed to maintain oil affordability,
   exacerbated the economic impact by creating shortages. High prices from
   the embargo were exacerbated by the shortages caused by the price
   controls, resulting in a series of recessions and high inflation that
   persisted until the early 1980's.

   The graph to the right is based on the nominal -- not real -- price of
   oil, and so understates prices of more recent years. However, the
   effects of the Arab Oil Embargo are clear: it effectively doubled the
   real price of crude oil at the refinery level. and caused massive
   shortages in the US. This exacerbated a recession that had already
   begun, and led to a global recession through the rest of 1974.

   Over the long term, the oil embargo changed the nature of policy in the
   West toward more exploration and energy conservation. Changes also
   included a more restrictive monetary policy that was better at fighting
   inflation.

 RESPONSE: 
  The 1973 oil crisis was a significant event in modern history that had far-reaching consequences for the global economy and political landscape. It was triggered by the Arab-Israeli conflict and the resulting oil embargo imposed by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) on October 17, 1973. The crisis was characterized by a quadrupling of world oil prices, which led to inflationary pressures in industrialized countries, particularly in the United States, Europe, and Japan.

The origins of the oil crisis can be traced back to the Arab-Israeli conflict, which had been ongoing since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. The conflict escalated in the early 1970s, with the Yom Kippur War of 1973 being a particularly significant event. In response to the West's support of Israel in the conflict, OAPEC announced the oil embargo, which was aimed at reducing oil shipments to countries that had supported Israel.

The oil embargo had a profound impact on the global economy. The price of oil increased dramatically, leading to a reduction in oil consumption and a subsequent decline in economic growth. The crisis also led to a series of recessions and high inflation, which persisted until the early 1980s. The crisis highlighted the dependence of industrialized countries on oil imports and the vulnerability of their economies to fluctuations in oil prices.

In response to the oil crisis, governments and industries around the world implemented various measures to reduce oil consumption and increase energy efficiency. These measures included the development of alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power, and the implementation of energy conservation policies, such as fuel efficiency standards and energy-saving technologies.

The 1973 oil crisis also had significant political implications. It led to a shift in the global balance of power, as oil-producing countries gained more influence over the global economy. It also led to a re-evaluation of the role of oil in the global economy and the need for more sustainable and diversified energy sources.

In conclusion, the 1973 oil crisis was a pivotal event in modern history that had far-reaching consequences for the global economy and political landscape. It highlighted the vulnerability of industrialized countries to fluctuations in oil prices and the need for more sustainable and diversified energy sources. The crisis also led to a shift in the global balance of power and a re-evaluation of the role of oil in the global economy.

   The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2004,
   and lasted until November 30, 2004. These dates conventionally delimit
   the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the
   Atlantic basin. However, the 2004 season exceeded these conventional
   limits slightly, as Tropical Storm Otto formed on the last day of the
   season and lasted two days into December. The season was well above
   average in activity, with fifteen named storms and one of the highest
   Accumulated Cyclone Energy totals ever observed.

   The season was notable as one of the deadliest and most costly Atlantic
   hurricane seasons on record, with at least 3,132 deaths and roughly $42
   billion (2004 US dollars) in damage. The most notable storms for the
   season were the four hurricanes that made landfall in the U.S. state of
   Florida, three of them with at least 115 mph (185 km/h) sustained
   winds: Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. Jeanne wreaked havoc in
   Haiti, killing approximately 3,000 people, while Ivan raged through
   Grenada, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands; Frances and Jeanne both hit
   the Bahamas at full force, while Charley caused significant damage in
   Cuba. Furthermore, all four of these hurricanes, as well as one
   tropical storm, hit the U.S. state of Florida, with Frances and Jeanne
   hitting nearly the exact same location within three weeks of each
   other; floodwaters in the southeastern United States were brought to
   near-record levels.

Pre-season outlook

   On May 17, prior to the start of the season, NOAA forecasters predicted
   a 50% probability of activity above the normal range, with 12–15
   tropical storms, 6–8 of those becoming hurricanes, and 2–4 of those
   hurricanes reaching at least Category 3 strength on the Saffir-Simpson
   Hurricane Scale.

   Noted hurricane expert Dr. William Gray's May 28 prediction was
   similar, with 14 named storms, 8 reaching hurricane strength, and 3
   reaching Category 3 strength.

Mid-season outlook

   On August 6, Dr. Gray announced he had revised his predictions slightly
   downwards, citing mild El Niño conditions, to 13 named storms, 7
   hurricanes, and 3 reaching category 3. Several days later, NOAA
   released an updated prediction as well, with a 90% probability of
   above-to-near normal activity, but the same number of storms forecast.

   A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 6 to 14 tropical storms, 4 to
   8 of which reach hurricane strength, and 1 to 3 of those reaching
   Category 3 strength.

   The season ended up with 16 tropical depressions, 15 named storms, 9
   hurricanes, and six major hurricanes, placing it well above all
   forecasts.

Seasonal activity

   Hurricane Ivan sank and stacked numerous boats at Bayou Grande Marina
   at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

   at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

   This season had 16 tropical depressions, 15 named storms, 9 hurricanes,
   and 6 major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson
   Hurricane Scale). The Accumulated Cyclone Energy figure of 225 ranks
   this as the fourth most active season since 1950 (behind the 2005
   season, the 1950 season and the 1995 season).

   August 2004 was unusually active, with eight named storms forming
   during the month. In an average year, only three or four storms would
   be named in August. The formation of eight named storms in August
   breaks the old record of seven for the month, set in the 1933 and 1995
   seasons. It also ties with September in the 2002 season for the most
   Atlantic tropical storms to form in any month.

Deaths and damage

   The 2004 season was very deadly, with over 3,000 deaths related to the
   flooding rains or winds caused by the storms. Nearly all of the deaths
   were reported in Haiti following the floods and mudslides caused by
   then-Tropical Storm Jeanne.

   A tropical low in May brought torrential flooding to Haiti and the
   Dominican Republic, killing 2,000 people and causing great damage.
   Though it was not officially classified as a tropical storm, it did
   have a circulation with loosely organized convection, resembling a
   subtropical cyclone.

Records and notable events

   The 2004 season had numerous unusual occurrences. The first named storm
   of the season formed on August 1, giving the season the fifth-latest
   start since the 1952 season. Tropical Storm Bonnie and Hurricane
   Charley became the first storms to sequentially hit the same U.S. state
   — Florida — within 24 hours of each other in recorded history. For the
   remainder of the season, Florida was hit by three more hurricanes:
   Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. It was the first time four hurricanes have
   hit one state in one season since four hurricanes hit the Texas coast
   in the 1886 season, including the Indianola Hurricane of 1886 that
   destroyed the city of Indianola.

   Other storms were individually unusual. Hurricane Alex was the
   strongest hurricane on record to intensify north of 38°N latitude. One
   storm, Tropical Storm Earl, died out, and its remains crossed over into
   the Pacific Ocean, regenerated, and became Hurricane Frank in the
   eastern Pacific.
   Hurricane Jeanne caused severe damage in Florida, Haiti, and other
   Caribbean countries.

   Caribbean countries.

   The most unusual storm of the season was Hurricane Ivan. Ivan first
   impressed meteorologists by becoming the first major Atlantic hurricane
   (Category 3 or above) on record to form as low as 10ºN latitude. Ivan
   was also recorded as the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on
   record up to that point (afterwards pushed to 9th by 2005's Katrina,
   Rita and Wilma), with a minimum central pressure of 910 mbar ( hPa).
   One very unusual occurrence in relation to Ivan happened on September
   22, when a remnant low from Ivan — which had traveled in a circular
   motion over the southeastern United States — was reclassified as a
   tropical depression as it moved over the Gulf of Mexico. The system was
   given the name Ivan and eventually strengthened into a respectable
   tropical storm with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) before making landfall
   along the coast of Texas, causing minimal flooding and damage.

   Although not part of the Atlantic hurricane season, one event in the
   South Atlantic was so unusual as to merit mention. On March 25, a
   tropical cyclone (unofficially named Cyclone Catarina) formed in the
   South Atlantic. Catarina is considered to be the first tropical cyclone
   to have formed in the South Atlantic since satellite observations
   began. It made landfall late on March 27 in the Brazilian state of
   Santa Catarina. The storm killed at least three and caused over $350
   million (2004 USD) in damage.

 RESPONSE: 
  The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season was a particularly active and deadly season, with 15 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). The season officially began on June 1, 2004, and ended on November 30, 2004.

The season was marked by several unusual occurrences, including the formation of eight named storms in August, which broke the old record of seven for the month. The season also saw the formation of Hurricane Alex, which became the strongest hurricane on record to intensify north of 38°N latitude.

The most notable storms of the season were Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne, which caused significant damage and flooding in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida. Hurricane Ivan was particularly deadly, with over 3,000 deaths related to the flooding rains or winds caused by the storm in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

The season also saw the formation of Tropical Storm Earl, which died out and regenerated in the eastern Pacific as Hurricane Frank. Additionally, Hurricane Jeanne caused severe damage in Florida, Haiti, and other Caribbean countries before making landfall in Texas.

Overall, the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season was well above average in activity, with a total of $42 billion in damage and at least 3,132 deaths. It remains one of the deadliest and most costly Atlantic hurricane seasons on record.

   The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active Atlantic
   hurricane season in recorded history, shattering previous records on
   repeated occasions. The impact of the season was widespread and ruinous
   with at least 2,280 deaths and record damages of over $100 billion USD.
   Of the storms that made landfall, five of the seven major
   hurricanes—Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma—were responsible for
   most of the destruction. The Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán
   and the U.S. states of Florida and Louisiana were each struck twice by
   major hurricanes; Cuba, the Bahamas, Haiti, Mississippi, Texas, and
   Tamaulipas were each struck once and in each case brushed by at least
   one more. The most catastrophic effects of the season were felt on the
   United States' Gulf Coast, where a 30-foot (10 meter) storm surge from
   Hurricane Katrina caused devastating flooding that inundated New
   Orleans, Louisiana and destroyed most structures on the Mississippi
   coastline, and in Guatemala, where Hurricane Stan combined with an
   extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides.

   The season officially began on June 1, 2005, and lasted until November
   30, although it effectively persisted into January 2006 due to
   continued storm activity. A record twenty-eight tropical and
   subtropical storms formed, of which a record fifteen became hurricanes.
   Of these, seven strengthened into major hurricanes, a record-tying five
   became Category 4 hurricanes and a record four reached Category 5
   strength, the highest categorization for hurricanes on the
   Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Among these Category 5 storms were
   Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, the former the costliest and the latter
   the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record.

   Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season
   by noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at
   Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the
   U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA). Prior to and during the 2005 season, Dr. Gray issued four
   forecasts, each time increasing the predicted level of activity. The
   NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two
   months into the season, drastically increasing the predicted level of
   activity in the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell far
   short of the actual activity of the season.

Preseason forecasts

   On December 3, 2004, Dr. Gray's team issued its first extended-range
   forecast for the 2005 season, predicting a slightly above-average
   season. Additionally, the team predicted a greatly increased chance of
   a major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States and the
   Florida peninsula. Though the forecast predicted above-average
   activity, the level predicted was significantly less than the 2004
   season. On April 1, 2005, after confirming that El Niño conditions
   would not develop, Dr. Gray and his team revised the December forecast
   upward, expecting thirteen tropical storms instead of eleven and seven
   hurricanes instead of six. In addition, the chance of a storm impacting
   the United States was raised slightly.

   On May 16, 2005, 15 days before the season began, NOAA issued its
   outlook for the 2005 season, forecasting a 70% chance of above-normal
   activity. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) value for the season was
   predicted to be 120–190% of the median. Shortly thereafter, on May 31,
   the day before the season officially began, Dr. Gray's team revised its
   April forecast upwards to 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 4 major
   hurricanes.

Midseason outlook

   On August 2, after an extraordinarily active early season, the NOAA
   released an updated outlook on the remainder of the season,
   significantly raising the expected level of activity to numbers about
   double those of a normal season. The ACE value was now forecast to be
   180 to 270% of the median. The NOAA also noted a higher than normal
   confidence in the forecast of above-normal activity. On August 5, 2005,
   Dr. Gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated
   forecast; it was consistent with NOAA's update. Although neither the
   NOAA nor Dr. Gray had ever forecast such high levels of activity, even
   the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual level of activity.

Storms

June and July

   On June 9, nearly two months earlier than when the 2004 season started,
   Tropical Storm Arlene formed in the western Caribbean, crossing Cuba
   before making landfall on the Florida Panhandle on the 11th. Arlene
   caused only moderate damage, although one swimmer was caught in a
   riptide and drowned in Miami Beach, Florida.

   Tropical Storm Bret formed in the Bay of Campeche on June 28 and made
   landfall in Veracruz the next morning. The storm damaged hundreds of
   homes and caused flooding which killed two people.

   Hurricane Cindy formed in the Gulf of Mexico on July 4. Originally
   thought to be a tropical storm, Cindy made landfall in Louisiana on the
   5th as a minimal hurricane, dropping up to 5 inches (130 mm) of rain,
   spawning several tornadoes, and killing three people. Cindy was
   upgraded to a hurricane in the post-storm analysis.

   On July 5, Hurricane Dennis formed in the eastern Caribbean; it crossed
   Grenada before intensifying into a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest
   ever recorded in July with a pressure of 930 mbar ( hPa). Dennis struck
   Cuba at full force, then made a final landfall on the Florida
   Panhandle. The hurricane killed 89 people (mostly in Haiti) and caused
   $4–$6 billion in damages in Cuba and the United States.

   Soon thereafter, Hurricane Emily formed in the Atlantic on July 11. It
   entered the Caribbean Sea and quickly intensified to a Category 4
   storm, breaking Dennis's record for July intensity when its pressure
   reached 929 mbar (hPa). Emily then briefly reached Category 5
   intensity—the earliest such storm ever recorded in the Atlantic. Emily
   crossed the Yucatán Peninsula at Category 4 strength before hitting
   Tamaulipas at Category 3 strength. Emily killed at least 14 people over
   the course of its path. An estimated $400 million in damages have been
   reported.

   Tropical Storm Franklin formed off the Bahamas on July 18. The storm
   moved northeast and became extratropical off the coast of Atlantic
   Canada without ever having threatened land.

   Tropical Storm Gert followed soon after on July 24. Gert struck
   Veracruz near where Emily had hit a few days before; roughly 1,000
   people were evacuated for fear of flooding, but no damages or deaths
   were reported.

August

   Like July, August also got off to a fast start: Tropical Storm Harvey
   formed southwest of Bermuda on August 3. Harvey dropped some rain on
   Bermuda as it moved to the northeast; it became extratropical on August
   8 in the open Atlantic Ocean.

   The tropical depression that would become Hurricane Irene formed west
   of the Cape Verde Islands on August 4. The system moved west and north
   and did not reach hurricane strength until August 14, at which point it
   became the second Cape Verde-type hurricane of the season. Irene turned
   northeast and briefly reached Category 2 status before weakening and
   becoming extratropical on August 18. It never posed a threat to land.

   Tropical Depression Ten formed east of the Lesser Antilles on August
   13. The system dissipated the next day. Its remnants soon merged with
   another system and eventually contributed to the formation of Hurricane
   Katrina.

   Tropical Storm Jose followed, forming in the Bay of Campeche on August
   22. It strengthened rapidly but quickly reached the coast and made
   landfall in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 23, preventing
   further strengthening. Jose forced 25,000 people to evacuate their
 RESPONSE: 
  The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active and destructive on record, shattering previous records throughout the season. The season began on June 1, 2005, and lasted until November 30, 2005, although it effectively persisted into January 2006 due to continued storm activity.

A total of 28 tropical and subtropical storms formed, of which 15 became hurricanes, and 7 strengthened into major hurricanes. Of these, 5 became Category 4 hurricanes, and 4 reached Category 5 strength, the highest categorization for hurricanes on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.

The most notable storms of the season were Hurricanes Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Dennis formed in the eastern Caribbean in July and intensified into a Category 4 hurricane, causing significant damage in Cuba and the United States. Emily formed in the Atlantic in July and became the earliest Category 5 storm ever recorded in the Atlantic, causing significant damage in the Yucatán Peninsula and Mexico. Katrina formed in the Gulf of Mexico in August and became the costliest hurricane in U.S. history, causing devastating flooding in New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Rita formed in the Gulf of Mexico in September and made landfall in Texas as a Category 3 hurricane, causing significant damage and flooding in the Houston area. Wilma formed in the Caribbean in October and intensified into a Category 5 hurricane, causing significant damage in Mexico and Central America.

The season also saw a record 20 storms make landfall in the United States, with 10 of those storms making landfall in Florida. The total damage from the season was estimated to be over $120 billion, with at least 2,280 deaths reported.

Forecasts for the season were issued by Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU) and by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Prior to the season, CSU issued four forecasts, each increasing the predicted level of activity. NOAA issued two forecasts, with the second release significantly increasing the predicted level of activity. However, all forecasts fell far short of the actual activity of the season.

1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Geology and geophysics

   The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens ( VEI = 5, 1.2 km³ of material
   erupted) is the most significant volcanic eruption to occur in the
   lower 48 U.S. states in recorded history, exceeding the destructive
   power and volume of material released by the 1915 eruption of
   California's Lassen Peak (the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in Alaska was
   the most powerful historic eruption in the U.S., although Alaska was
   not a U.S. state at the time). The eruption was preceded by a
   two-month-long series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused
   by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the mountain which
   created a huge bulge and a fracture system on Mount St. Helens' north
   slope. An earthquake at 8:32 a.m. on May 18, 1980, caused the entire
   weakened north face to slide away, suddenly exposing the partly molten,
   gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to lower pressure. The rock
   responded by exploding into a super-heated mix of pulverized lava and
   older rock that sped toward Spirit Lake so fast that it quickly passed
   the avalanching north face.

   A volcanic ash column rose high into the atmosphere and deposited ash
   in eleven U.S. states. At the same time, snow, ice, and several entire
   glaciers on the mountain melted, forming a series of large lahars
   (volcanic mudslides) that reached as far as the Columbia River. Less
   severe outbursts continued into the next day only to be followed by
   other large but not as destructive eruptions later in 1980. By the time
   the ash settled, 57 people (including innkeeper Harry Truman and
   geologist David A. Johnston) and thousands of animals were dead,
   hundreds of square miles (mi²) reduced to wasteland, over a billion
   U.S. dollars in damage had occurred, and the once-graceful face of
   Mount St. Helens was scarred with a huge crater open to the north. The
   area was later preserved, as it was, in the Mount St. Helens National
   Volcanic Monument.

Buildup to disaster

   Mount St. Helens, May 17, 1980.
   Enlarge
   Mount St. Helens, May 17, 1980.

   Several small earthquakes beginning as early as March 16, 1980,
   indicated that magma may have been moving below the volcano. Then on
   March 20 at 3:47 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST),
   a shallow Richter magnitude 4.2 earthquake, centered below the
   mountain's north flank, definitely signaled the volcano's violent
   return from 123 years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake
   swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon
   on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days (a total of 174
   shocks of 2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days). Shocks
   of 3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate through April
   and May with five earthquakes of magnitude 4 or above per day in early
   April, and 8 per day the week before May 18. Initially there was no
   direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of
   snow and ice were reported from aerial observations.

   Then at 12:36 p.m. on March 27, at least one but possibly two nearly
   simultaneous phreatic eruptions (exploding groundwater-derived steam)
   ejected smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a
   new crater 250 feet (76 m) wide and sending an ash column about 6,000
   feet (1800 m) into the air. Also by this date, a 16,000-foot-long (4900
   m), east-trending fracture system had developed across the summit area.
   This was followed by more earthquake storms and a series of steam
   explosions that sent ash 10,000 to 11,000 feet (3050 to 3350 m) above
   their vent. Most of this ash fell within 3 to 12 miles (5 to 19 km)
   from its vent but some was carried as far as 150 miles (240 km) south
   to Bend, Oregon, and 285 miles (459 km) east to Spokane, Washington.

   A second, new crater and a blue flame were observed on March 29. The
   flame danced to and from the two craters and was probably created by
   burning gases. Static electricity generated from ash clouds rolling
   down the mountain sent out lightning bolts that were up to two miles (3
   km) long. Ninety-three separate outbursts were reported on March 30,
   and harmonic tremors were detected on April 3, alarming geologists and
   prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency.

   By April 8 the two craters merged, eventually creating one that was
   1,700 to 850 feet (520 to 260 m) wide. A USGS team determined in the
   last week of April that a 1.5-mile-diameter (2.4 km) section of St.
   Helens' north face was displaced out at least 270 feet (82 m). For the
   rest of April and early May this bulge grew 5 to 6 feet per day (1.5 to
   1.8 m), and by mid-May it extended more than 400 feet (120 m) north. As
   the bulge moved northward, the summit area behind it progressively
   sank, forming a complex, down-dropped block called a graben. Geologists
   announced on April 30 that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest
   immediate danger and that such a landslide may spark an eruption. These
   changes in the volcano's shape were related to the overall deformation
   that increased the volume of the mountain by 0.03 cubic miles
   (125,000,000 m³) by mid-May. This volume increase presumably
   corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and
   deformed its surface. Because the intruded magma remained below ground
   and was not directly visible, it was called a cryptodome, in contrast
   to a true lava dome exposed at the surface.

   Photo showing the bulge on April 27.

   On May 7, eruptions similar to those in March and April resumed, and
   over the next several days the bulge grew to huge proportions. All
   activity to this point was confined to the 350-year-old summit dome and
   did not involve any new magma. A total of about 10,000 earthquakes were
   recorded prior to the May 18 event, with most concentrated in a small
   zone less than 1.6 miles (2.6 km) directly below the bulge. Visible
   eruptions ceased on May 16, reducing public interest and consequently
   the number of spectators in the area. Mounting public pressure then
   forced officials to allow a limited number of people to enter the
   danger zone on May 17 to gather whatever property they could carry.
   Another trip was scheduled for 10 a.m. the next morning. Since that was
   Sunday, more than 300 loggers would not be working in the area. By the
   time of the climactic eruption, an estimated 0.11 cubic kilometers of
   dacite magma had intruded into the volcano. The rising magma forced the
   volcano's north flank outward nearly 500 feet (150 m) and heated the
   volcano's groundwater system, causing many steam-driven explosions
   (phreatic eruptions).

   At 7 a.m. on May 18, USGS volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had
   Saturday night duty at an observation post about 6 miles (10 km) north
   of the mountain, radioed in the results of some laser-beam measurements
   he had made moments earlier. Mount St. Helens' activity that day did
   not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month. The rate
   of bulge movement, sulfur-dioxide gas emission, and ground temperature

 RESPONSE: 
  On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens in Washington state erupted in the most significant volcanic event to occur in the lower 48 United States in recorded history. The eruption was preceded by a series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes caused by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the mountain. At 8:32 a.m., a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope of the mountain triggered a massive landslide that occurred approximately 7-20 seconds after the earthquake, traveling at speeds of 110-155 miles per hour and moving across Spirit Lake's west arm. The landslide hit a 1,150-foot-high ridge about 6 miles north of the mountain.

The eruption resulted in the deaths of 57 people, including innkeeper Harry Truman and geologist David A. Johnston, as well as the destruction of hundreds of square miles of land and over $1 billion in damage. The area was later preserved, as it was, in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. The eruption also caused the north face of the mountain to slide away, exposing the partly molten, gas- and steam-rich rock beneath, which exploded into a super-heated mix of pulverized lava and older rock that sped towards Spirit Lake so fast that it quickly passed the avalanching north face.

The ash column rose high into the atmosphere and deposited ash in 11 states, while snow, ice, and several entire glaciers on the mountain melted, forming a series of large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that reached as far as the Columbia River. Less severe outbursts continued into the next day, followed by other large but not as destructive eruptions later in 1980. By the time the ash settled, the area was reduced to wasteland, and the once-graceful face of Mount St. Helens was scarred with a huge crater open to the north.

   Édouard Manet ( January 23, 1832 – April 30, 1883) was a French
   painter. One of the first nineteenth century artists to approach
   modern-life subjects, he was a pivotal figure in the transition from
   Realism to Impressionism. His early masterworks The Luncheon on the
   Grass and Olympia engendered great controversy, and served as rallying
   points for the young painters who would create Impressionism—today
   these are considered watershed paintings that mark the genesis of
   modern art.

Biography

Early life

   Édouard Manet was born in Paris in 1832 to an affluent and well
   connected family. His mother, Eugénie-Desirée Fournier, was the
   goddaughter of the Swedish crown prince, Charles Bernadotte, from whom
   the current Swedish monarchs are descended. His father, Auguste Manet,
   was a French judge who expected Édouard to pursue a career in law. His
   uncle, Charles Fournier, encouraged him to pursue painting and often
   took young Manet to the Louvre.

   From 1850 to 1856, after failing the examination to join the navy,
   Manet studied under the academic painter Thomas Couture. In his spare
   time he copied the old masters in the Louvre.

   He visited Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, during which time he
   absorbed the influences of the Dutch painter Frans Hals, and the
   Spanish artists Diego Velázquez and Francisco José de Goya.

   In 1856, he opened his own studio. His style in this period was
   characterized by loose brush strokes, simplification of details, and
   the suppression of transitional tones. Adopting the current style of
   realism initiated by Gustave Courbet, he painted The Absinthe Drinker
   (1858-59) and other contemporary subjects such as beggars, singers,
   Gypsies, people in cafés, and bullfights. After his early years, he
   rarely painted religious, mythological, or historical subjects;
   examples include his Christ Mocked, now in the Art Institute of
   Chicago, and Christ with Angels, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New
   York.

Music in the Tuileries

   Music in the Tuileries, 1862
   Music in the Tuileries, 1862

   Music in the Tuileries is an early example of Manet's painterly style,
   inspired by Hals and Velázquez, and it is a harbinger of his life-long
   interest in the subject of leisure.

   While the picture was not regarded as finished by some, the suggested
   atmosphere imparts a sense of what the Tuileries gardens were like at
   the time; one may imagine the music and conversation.

   Here Manet has depicted his friends, artists, authors, and musicians
   who take part, and he has included a self-portrait among the subjects.

Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe)

   The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe), 1863
   The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe), 1863

   A major early work is The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur
   l'herbe). The Paris Salon rejected it for exhibition in 1863, but he
   exhibited it at the Salon des Refusés (Salon of the rejected) later in
   the year. Emperor Napoleon III had initiated The Salon des Refusés,
   after the Paris Salon rejected more than 4,000 paintings in 1863.

   The painting's juxtaposition of fully-dressed men and a nude woman was
   controversial, as was its abbreviated, sketch-like handling—an
   innovation that distinguished Manet from Courbet. At the same time,
   Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the
   disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi's
   engraving Urteil des Paris (c. 1515) after his copy from a drawing by
   Raphael.

   Scholars also cite as an important precedent for Manet's painting Le
   déjeuner sur l'herbe, The Tempest which is a famous Renaissance
   painting by Italian master Giorgione (around 1508). It is housed in the
   Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice, Italy. The mysterious and enigmatic
   painting also features a fully dressed man and a nude female in a rural
   setting. The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side,
   apparently at the woman; a partially nude woman, who is sitting in a
   landscape, and is breastfeeding a baby. While darkening clouds and
   distant lightening herald an approaching storm. The relationship
   between the two figures is unclear.

Olympia

   Olympia, 1863
   Olympia, 1863

   As he had in Luncheon on the Grass, Manet again paraphrased a respected
   work by a Renaissance artist in the painting Olympia ( 1863), a nude
   portrayed in a style reminiscent of early studio photographs, but whose
   pose was based on Titian's Venus of Urbino ( 1538).

   The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some
   small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a
   ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her
   nakedness. This modern Venus' body is thin, counter to prevailing
   standards; thin women were not considered attractive at the time, and
   the painting's lack of idealism rankled. A fully-dressed servant is
   featured, exploiting the same juxtaposition as in Luncheon on the
   Grass.

   Manet's Olympia also was considered shocking because of the manner in
   which the subject acknowledges the viewer. She defiantly looks out as
   her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her
   hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the reference to
   traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously
   absent in this work. The alert black cat at the foot of the bed strikes
   a rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian's
   portrayal of the goddess in his Venus of Urbino. Manet's uniquely frank
   (and largely unpopular) depiction of a self-assured prostitute was
   rejected by the Paris Salon of 1863. At the same time, his notoriety
   translated to popularity in the French avant-garde community.

   As with Luncheon on the Grass, the painting raised the issue of
   prostitution within contemporary France and the roles of women within
   society.

Life and times

   Berthe Morisot, 1872
   Berthe Morisot, 1872

   The roughly painted style and photographic lighting in these works was
   seen as specifically modern, and as a challenge to the Renaissance
   works Manet copied or used as source material. His work is considered
   'early modern', partially because of the black outlining of figures,
   which draws attention to the surface of the picture plane and the
   material quality of paint.

   He became friends with the Impressionists Edgar Degas, Claude Monet,
   Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Paul Cézanne, and Camille
   Pissarro, through another painter, Berthe Morisot, who was a member of
   the group and drew him into their activities. The grand niece of the
   painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Morisot's paintings first had been
   accepted in the Salon de Paris in 1864 and she continued to show in the
   salon for ten years.

   Manet became the friend and colleague of Berthe Morisot in 1868. She is
   credited with convincing Manet to attempt plein air painting, which she
   had been practicing since she had been introduced to it by another
   friend of hers, Camille Corot. They had a reciprocating relationship
   and Manet incorporated some of her techniques into his paintings. In
   1874, she become his sister-in-law when she married his brother,
   Eugene.

   Self-portrait with palette, 1879.

   Unlike the core Impressionist group, Manet maintained that modern
   artists should seek to exhibit at the Paris Salon rather than abandon
   it in favour of independent exhibitions. Nevertheless, when Manet was
   excluded from the International exhibition of 1867, he set up his own
   exhibition. His mother worried that he would waste all his inheritance
   on this project, which was enormously expensive. While the exhibition
   earned poor reviews from the major critics, it also provided his first
   contacts with several future Impressionist painters, including Degas.

   Although his own work influenced and anticipated the Impressionist
   style, he resisted involvement in Impressionist exhibitions, partly
   because he did not wish to be seen as the representative of a group
   identity, and partly because he preferred to exhibit at the Salon. Eva
   Gonzalès was his only formal student.

   He was influenced by the Impressionists, especially Monet and Morisot.
   Their influence is seen in Manet's use of lighter colors, but he
   retained his distinctive use of black, uncharacteristic of
   Impressionist painting. He painted many outdoor ( plein air) pieces,
   but always returned to what he considered the serious work of the
   studio.

   Throughout his life, although resisted by art critics, Manet could
   number as his champions Émile Zola, who supported him publicly in the
 RESPONSE: 
  Édouard Manet had a significant influence on Europe, particularly in the realm of modern art. His innovative style and willingness to challenge traditional artistic norms helped pave the way for the Impressionist movement. Here are some ways in which Manet's influence can be seen:

1. Modern Subject Matter: Manet was one of the first artists to approach modern-life subjects in his paintings. His early masterworks, such as "The Luncheon on the Grass" and "Olympia," engendered great controversy and served as rallying points for young painters who would create Impressionism. These works marked a significant shift away from traditional historical and religious subjects and towards contemporary life.
2. Simplification of Details: Manet adopted the current style of realism initiated by Gustave Courbet, simplifying details and suppressing transitional tones in his paintings. This approach allowed him to capture the essence of modern life with greater accuracy and immediacy.
3. Adoption of Photographic Techniques: Manet's roughly painted style and photographic lighting were seen as specifically modern. His work drew attention to the surface of the picture plane and the material quality of paint, which was a departure from the traditional emphasis on illusionism.
4. Influence on Impressionism: Manet's friendship with the Impressionists, such as Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Paul Cézanne, and Camille Pissarro, helped to shape the Impressionist movement. He became a mentor to some of these artists, and his innovative style and willingness to challenge traditional artistic norms influenced their work.
5. Use of Light and Color: Manet's use of lighter colors and his willingness to experiment with new techniques, such as plein air painting, influenced the Impressionist style. His distinctive use of black, however, remained uncharacteristic of Impressionist painting.
6. Influence on Future Generations: Manet's work continued to influence artists long after his death. His innovative style and willingness to challenge traditional artistic norms have made him a hero to many artists, including the Expressionists, Fauves, and Cubists.

In summary, Édouard Manet's influence on Europe was significant, as he helped to shape the course of modern art through his innovative style, willingness to challenge traditional norms, and friendship with the Impressionists. His work continues to inspire artists to this day, and his legacy as a pioneer of modern art is secure.

   interest in the subject of leisure.

   While the picture was not regarded as finished by some, the suggested
   atmosphere imparts a sense of what the Tuileries gardens were like at
   the time; one may imagine the music and conversation.

   Here Manet has depicted his friends, artists, authors, and musicians
   who take part, and he has included a self-portrait among the subjects.

Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe)

   The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe), 1863
   The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe), 1863

   A major early work is The Luncheon on the Grass (Le déjeuner sur
   l'herbe). The Paris Salon rejected it for exhibition in 1863, but he
   exhibited it at the Salon des Refusés (Salon of the rejected) later in
   the year. Emperor Napoleon III had initiated The Salon des Refusés,
   after the Paris Salon rejected more than 4,000 paintings in 1863.

   The painting's juxtaposition of fully-dressed men and a nude woman was
   controversial, as was its abbreviated, sketch-like handling—an
   innovation that distinguished Manet from Courbet. At the same time,
   Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the
   disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi's
   engraving Urteil des Paris (c. 1515) after his copy from a drawing by
   Raphael.

   Scholars also cite as an important precedent for Manet's painting Le
   déjeuner sur l'herbe, The Tempest which is a famous Renaissance
   painting by Italian master Giorgione (around 1508). It is housed in the
   Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice, Italy. The mysterious and enigmatic
   painting also features a fully dressed man and a nude female in a rural
   setting. The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side,
   apparently at the woman; a partially nude woman, who is sitting in a
   landscape, and is breastfeeding a baby. While darkening clouds and
   distant lightening herald an approaching storm. The relationship
   between the two figures is unclear.

Olympia

   Olympia, 1863
   Olympia, 1863

   As he had in Luncheon on the Grass, Manet again paraphrased a respected
   work by a Renaissance artist in the painting Olympia ( 1863), a nude
   portrayed in a style reminiscent of early studio photographs, but whose
   pose was based on Titian's Venus of Urbino ( 1538).

   The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some
   small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a
   ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her
   nakedness. This modern Venus' body is thin, counter to prevailing
   standards; thin women were not considered attractive at the time, and
   the painting's lack of idealism rankled. A fully-dressed servant is
   featured, exploiting the same juxtaposition as in Luncheon on the
   Grass.

   Manet's Olympia also was considered shocking because of the manner in
   which the subject acknowledges the viewer. She defiantly looks out as
   her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her
   hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the reference to
   traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously
   absent in this work. The alert black cat at the foot of the bed strikes
   a rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian's
   portrayal of the goddess in his Venus of Urbino. Manet's uniquely frank
   (and largely unpopular) depiction of a self-assured prostitute was
   rejected by the Paris Salon of 1863. At the same time, his notoriety
   translated to popularity in the French avant-garde community.

   As with Luncheon on the Grass, the painting raised the issue of
   prostitution within contemporary France and the roles of women within
   society.

Life and times

   Berthe Morisot, 1872

   The roughly painted style and photographic lighting in these works was
   seen as specifically modern, and as a challenge to the Renaissance
   works Manet copied or used as source material. His work is considered
   'early modern', partially because of the black outlining of figures,
   which draws attention to the surface of the picture plane and the
   material quality of paint.

   He became friends with the Impressionists Edgar Degas, Claude Monet,
   Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Paul Cézanne, and Camille
   Pissarro, through another painter, Berthe Morisot, who was a member of
   the group and drew him into their activities. The grand niece of the
   painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Morisot's paintings first had been
   accepted in the Salon de Paris in 1864 and she continued to show in the
   salon for ten years.

   Manet became the friend and colleague of Berthe Morisot in 1868. She is
   credited with convincing Manet to attempt plein air painting, which she
   had been practicing since she had been introduced to it by another
   friend of hers, Camille Corot. They had a reciprocating relationship
   and Manet incorporated some of her techniques into his paintings. In
   1874, she become his sister-in-law when she married his brother,
   Eugene.

   Self-portrait with palette, 1879.

   Unlike the core Impressionist group, Manet maintained that modern
   artists should seek to exhibit at the Paris Salon rather than abandon
   it in favour of independent exhibitions. Nevertheless, when Manet was
   excluded from the International exhibition of 1867, he set up his own
   exhibition. His mother worried that he would waste all his inheritance
   on this project, which was enormously expensive. While the exhibition
   earned poor reviews from the major critics, it also provided his first
   contacts with several future Impressionist painters, including Degas.

   Although his own work influenced and anticipated the Impressionist
   style, he resisted involvement in Impressionist exhibitions, partly
   because he did not wish to be seen as the representative of a group
   identity, and partly because he preferred to exhibit at the Salon. Eva
   Gonzalès was his only formal student.

   He was influenced by the Impressionists, especially Monet and Morisot.
   Their influence is seen in Manet's use of lighter colors, but he
   retained his distinctive use of black, uncharacteristic of
   Impressionist painting. He painted many outdoor ( plein air) pieces,
   but always returned to what he considered the serious work of the
   studio.

   Throughout his life, although resisted by art critics, Manet could
   number as his champions Émile Zola, who supported him publicly in the
 RESPONSE: 
  Based on the provided text, Édouard Manet would likely paint works that blend modern-life subjects with a loose brush stroke, simplified details, and suppressed transitional tones, much like his early masterworks The Luncheon on the Grass and Olympia. He might also explore themes of leisure, music, and modernity, as seen in his early works Music in the Tuileries and Olympia. Additionally, Manet's interest in the old masters and his paraphrasing of respected works by Renaissance artists, such as Titian's Venus of Urbino, could be evident in his paintings. His friendship and collaboration with the Impressionists, including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Berthe Morisot, might also influence his style and subject matter, as seen in his use of lighter colors and outdoor (plein air) pieces. Overall, Manet's paintings would likely reflect his innovative and experimental approach to art, as well as his interest in modern life and society.

   The tsunami caused by the December 26, 2004 earthquake strikes Ao Nang,
   Thailand.

   The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, known by the scientific community as
   the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, was an undersea earthquake that
   occurred at 00:58:53 UTC (07:58:53 local time) December 26, 2004 with
   an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The earthquake
   triggered a series of devastating tsunamis that spread throughout the
   Indian Ocean, killing large numbers of people and inundating coastal
   communities across South and Southeast Asia, including parts of
   Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. Although initial estimates
   have put the worldwide death toll at over 275,000 with thousands of
   others missing, recent analysis compiled lists a total of 229,866
   persons lost, including 186,983 dead and 42,883 missing. The figure
   excludes 400 to 600 people who are believed to have perished in Myanmar
   which is more than that government's official figure of only 61 dead.
   The catastrophe is one of the deadliest disasters in modern history.
   The disaster is known in Asia and in the international media as the
   Asian Tsunami, and also called the Boxing Day Tsunami in Australia,
   Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as it took place on Boxing
   Day. Coincidentally, the tsunami occurred exactly one year after the
   2003 earthquake that devastated the southern Iranian city of Bam.

   The magnitude of the earthquake was originally recorded as 9.0 on the
   Richter scale, but has been upgraded to between 9.1 and 9.3. At this
   magnitude, it is the second largest earthquake ever recorded on a
   seismograph. This earthquake was also reported to be the longest
   duration of faulting ever observed, lasting between 500 and 600
   seconds, and it was large enough that it caused the entire planet to
   vibrate at least half an inch, or over a centimetre. It also triggered
   earthquakes in other locations as far away as Alaska.

   The earthquake originated in the Indian Ocean just north of Simeulue
   island, off the western coast of northern Sumatra. The resulting
   tsunami devastated the shores of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand
   and other countries with waves up to 30 m (100 ft). It caused serious
   damage and deaths as far as the east coast of Africa, with the furthest
   recorded death due to the tsunami occurring at Rooi Els in South
   Africa, 8,000 km (5,000 mi) away from the epicentre. In total, eight
   people in South Africa died due to abnormally high sea levels and
   waves.

   The plight of the many affected people and countries prompted a
   widespread humanitarian response. In all, the worldwide community
   donated more than US$7 billion in humanitarian aid to those affected by
   the earthquake.

Earthquake characteristics

   Epicentre of the earthquake, just north of Simeulue Island

   The earthquake was initially reported as moment magnitude, Mw 9.0.
   (Notice that this is not the so-called Richter scale or local magnitude
   scale, ML, which is known to saturate at higher magnitudes.) In
   February 2005 some scientists revised the estimate of the magnitude to
   9.3. Although the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre has accepted these new
   numbers, the United States Geological Survey has so far not changed its
   estimate of 9.1. The most recent studies in 2006 have obtained a
   magnitude of Mw 9.1 to 9.3. Dr. Hiroo Kanamori of the California
   Institute of Technology believes that Mw = 9.2 is a good representative
   value for the size of this great earthquake. Reference: EERI
   Publication 2006-06, page 14 [www.eeri.org]

   The hypocentre of the main earthquake was at 3.316°N, 95.854°E ( 3°19′N
   95°51.24′E), approximately 160 km (100 mi) west of Sumatra, at a depth
   of 30 km (19 mi) below mean sea level (initially reported as 10 km).
   The earthquake itself (apart from the tsunami) was felt as far away as
   Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore and the
   Maldives.

   Indonesia lies between the Pacific Ring of Fire along the north-eastern
   islands adjacent to and including New Guinea and the Alpide belt along
   the south and west from Sumatra, Java, Bali, Flores, and Timor. The
   December 2004 earthquake actually occurred within the Alpide belt.

   Since 1900 the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude were
   the 1960 Great Chilean Earthquake (magnitude 9.5) and the 1964 Good
   Friday Earthquake in Prince William Sound (9.2). The only other
   recorded earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater was off Kamchatka,
   Russia, on November 4, 1952 (magnitude 9.0). Each of these megathrust
   earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean, but the death
   toll from these was significantly lower. The worst of these caused only
   a few thousand deaths, primarily because of the lower population
   density along the coasts near affected areas and the much greater
   distances to more populated coasts.

   Other very large megathrust earthquakes occurred in 1868 (Peru, Nazca
   Plate and South American Plate); 1827 (Colombia, Nazca Plate and South
   American Plate); 1812 (Venezuela, Caribbean Plate and South American
   Plate) and 1700 ( Cascadia Earthquake, western U.S. and Canada, Juan de
   Fuca Plate and North American Plate). These are all believed to have
   been of greater than magnitude 9, but no accurate measurements were
   available at the time.

Tectonic plates

   The earthquake was unusually large in geographical extent. An estimated
   1,200 km (750 mi) of faultline slipped about 15 m (50 ft) along the
   subduction zone where the India Plate dives under the Burma Plate. The
   slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over a
   period of several minutes. Seismographic and acoustic data indicate
   that the first phase involved the formation of a rupture about 400 km
   (250 mi) long and 100 km (60 mi) wide, located 30 km (19 mi) beneath
   the sea bed—the longest rupture ever known to have been caused by an
   earthquake. The rupture proceeded at a speed of about 2.8 km/s (1.7
   mi/s) or 10,000 km/h (6,300 mph), beginning off the coast of Aceh and
   proceeding north-westerly over a period of about 100 seconds. A pause
   of about another 100 seconds took place before the rupture continued
   northwards towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. However, the
   northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about
   2.1 km/s (1.3  mi/s) or 7,600 km/h (4,700 mph), continuing north for
   another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault changes from
   subduction to strike-slip (the two plates push past one another in
   opposite directions). This reduced the speed of the water displacement
   and so reducing the size of the tsunami that hit the northern part of
   the Indian Ocean.

   The India Plate is part of the great Indo-Australian Plate, which
   underlies the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, and is drifting
   north-east at an average of 6 cm/year (2 inches per year). The India
   Plate meets the Burma Plate (which is considered a portion of the great
   Eurasian Plate) at the Sunda Trench. At this point the India Plate
   subducts beneath the Burma Plate, which carries the Nicobar Islands,
   the Andaman Islands and northern Sumatra. The India Plate slips deeper
   and deeper beneath the Burma Plate until the increasing temperature and
   pressure drive volatiles out of the subducting plate. These volatiles
   rise into the crust above and trigger melt which exits the earth's
   crust through volcanoes in the form of a volcanic arc. The volcanic
   activity that results as the Indo-Australian plate subducts the
   Eurasian plate has created the Sunda Arc.

   As well as the sideways movement between the plates, the sea bed is
   estimated to have risen by several metres, displacing an estimated
   30 km³ (7 cu mi) of water and triggering devastating tsunami waves. The
   waves did not originate from a point source, as mistakenly depicted in
   some illustrations of their spread, but radiated outwards along the
   entire 1,200 km (750 mi) length of the rupture (acting as a line
   source). This greatly increased the geographical area over which the
   waves were observed, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile and the Arctic.
   The raising of the sea bed significantly reduced the capacity of the
   Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the global sea level by an
   estimated 0.1 mm.

 RESPONSE: 
  The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, also known as the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, had significant relationships with the South China Sea. The earthquake occurred off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, in the Indian Ocean, and its epicenter was located north of Simeulue Island. The earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that affected several countries in the region, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, and Myanmar.

The earthquake had a magnitude of 9.1 to 9.3, making it one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded on a seismograph. The hypocenter of the main earthquake was located at 3.316°N, 95.854°E, approximately 160 km west of Sumatra, at a depth of 30 km below mean sea level. The earthquake itself was felt as far away as Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, and the Maldives.

The earthquake was caused by the subduction of the India Plate beneath the Burma Plate, which is part of the great Indo-Australian Plate. The India Plate is drifting north-east at an average of 6 cm/year, and as it meets the Burma Plate, it subducts beneath it, causing the volatiles to rise into the crust above and triggering melt that exits the earth's crust through volcanoes in the form of a volcanic arc. The volcanic activity in the Sunda Arc is responsible for the tsunami waves that affected several countries in the region.

The earthquake and tsunami had significant impacts on the countries in the region, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, and Myanmar. The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread damage and loss of life, with the death toll estimated to be over 275,000. The disaster also triggered a massive humanitarian response, with donations of over $7 billion to affected countries.

In conclusion, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake had significant relationships with the South China Sea, as it occurred in the Indian Ocean and triggered a massive tsunami that affected several countries in the region. The earthquake was caused by the subduction of the India Plate beneath the Burma Plate, which is part of the great Indo-Australian Plate. The earthquake and tsunami had significant impacts on the countries in the region, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, and Myanmar, causing widespread damage and loss of life.

1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Geology and geophysics

   The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens ( VEI = 5, 1.2 km³ of material
   erupted) is the most significant volcanic eruption to occur in the
   lower 48 U.S. states in recorded history, exceeding the destructive
   power and volume of material released by the 1915 eruption of
   California's Lassen Peak (the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in Alaska was
   the most powerful historic eruption in the U.S., although Alaska was
   not a U.S. state at the time). The eruption was preceded by a
   two-month-long series of earthquakes and steam-venting episodes, caused
   by an injection of magma at shallow depth below the mountain which
   created a huge bulge and a fracture system on Mount St. Helens' north
   slope. An earthquake at 8:32 a.m. on May 18, 1980, caused the entire
   weakened north face to slide away, suddenly exposing the partly molten,
   gas- and steam-rich rock in the volcano to lower pressure. The rock
   responded by exploding into a super-heated mix of pulverized lava and
   older rock that sped toward Spirit Lake so fast that it quickly passed
   the avalanching north face.

   A volcanic ash column rose high into the atmosphere and deposited ash
   in eleven U.S. states. At the same time, snow, ice, and several entire
   glaciers on the mountain melted, forming a series of large lahars
   (volcanic mudslides) that reached as far as the Columbia River. Less
   severe outbursts continued into the next day only to be followed by
   other large but not as destructive eruptions later in 1980. By the time
   the ash settled, 57 people (including innkeeper Harry Truman and
   geologist David A. Johnston) and thousands of animals were dead,
   hundreds of square miles (mi²) reduced to wasteland, over a billion
   U.S. dollars in damage had occurred, and the once-graceful face of
   Mount St. Helens was scarred with a huge crater open to the north. The
   area was later preserved, as it was, in the Mount St. Helens National
   Volcanic Monument.

Buildup to disaster

   Mount St. Helens, May 17, 1980.
   Enlarge
   Mount St. Helens, May 17, 1980.

   Several small earthquakes beginning as early as March 16, 1980,
   indicated that magma may have been moving below the volcano. Then on
   March 20 at 3:47 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST),
   a shallow Richter magnitude 4.2 earthquake, centered below the
   mountain's north flank, definitely signaled the volcano's violent
   return from 123 years of hibernation. A gradually building earthquake
   swarm saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon
   on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days (a total of 174
   shocks of 2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days). Shocks
   of 3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate through April
   and May with five earthquakes of magnitude 4 or above per day in early
   April, and 8 per day the week before May 18. Initially there was no
   direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of
   snow and ice were reported from aerial observations.

   Then at 12:36 p.m. on March 27, at least one but possibly two nearly
   simultaneous phreatic eruptions (exploding groundwater-derived steam)
   ejected smashed rock from within the old summit crater, excavating a
   new crater 250 feet (76 m) wide and sending an ash column about 6,000
   feet (1800 m) into the air. Also by this date, a 16,000-foot-long (4900
   m), east-trending fracture system had developed across the summit area.
   This was followed by more earthquake storms and a series of steam
   explosions that sent ash 10,000 to 11,000 feet (3050 to 3350 m) above
   their vent. Most of this ash fell within 3 to 12 miles (5 to 19 km)
   from its vent but some was carried as far as 150 miles (240 km) south
   to Bend, Oregon, and 285 miles (459 km) east to Spokane, Washington.

   A second, new crater and a blue flame were observed on March 29. The
   flame danced to and from the two craters and was probably created by
   burning gases. Static electricity generated from ash clouds rolling
   down the mountain sent out lightning bolts that were up to two miles (3
   km) long. Ninety-three separate outbursts were reported on March 30,
   and harmonic tremors were detected on April 3, alarming geologists and
   prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency.

   By April 8 the two craters merged, eventually creating one that was
   1,700 to 850 feet (520 to 260 m) wide. A USGS team determined in the
   last week of April that a 1.5-mile-diameter (2.4 km) section of St.
   Helens' north face was displaced out at least 270 feet (82 m). For the
   rest of April and early May this bulge grew 5 to 6 feet per day (1.5 to
   1.8 m), and by mid-May it extended more than 400 feet (120 m) north. As
   the bulge moved northward, the summit area behind it progressively
   sank, forming a complex, down-dropped block called a graben. Geologists
   announced on April 30 that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest
   immediate danger and that such a landslide may spark an eruption. These
   changes in the volcano's shape were related to the overall deformation
   that increased the volume of the mountain by 0.03 cubic miles
   (125,000,000 m³) by mid-May. This volume increase presumably
   corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and
   deformed its surface. Because the intruded magma remained below ground
   and was not directly visible, it was called a cryptodome, in contrast
   to a true lava dome exposed at the surface.
   Photo showing the bulge on April 27.
   Enlarge
   Photo showing the bulge on April 27.

   On May 7, eruptions similar to those in March and April resumed, and
   over the next several days the bulge grew to huge proportions. All
   activity to this point was confined to the 350-year-old summit dome and
   did not involve any new magma. A total of about 10,000 earthquakes were
   recorded prior to the May 18 event, with most concentrated in a small
   zone less than 1.6 miles (2.6 km) directly below the bulge. Visible
   eruptions ceased on May 16, reducing public interest and consequently
   the number of spectators in the area. Mounting public pressure then
   forced officials to allow a limited number of people to enter the
   danger zone on May 17 to gather whatever property they could carry.
   Another trip was scheduled for 10 a.m. the next morning. Since that was
   Sunday, more than 300 loggers would not be working in the area. By the
   time of the climactic eruption, an estimated 0.11 cubic kilometers of
   dacite magma had intruded into the volcano. The rising magma forced the
   volcano's north flank outward nearly 500 feet (150 m) and heated the
   volcano's groundwater system, causing many steam-driven explosions
   (phreatic eruptions).

   At 7 a.m. on May 18, USGS volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had
   Saturday night duty at an observation post about 6 miles (10 km) north
   of the mountain, radioed in the results of some laser-beam measurements
   he had made moments earlier. Mount St. Helens' activity that day did
   not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month. The rate
   of bulge movement, sulfur-dioxide gas emission, and ground temperature
   readings did not reveal any unusual changes that might indicate a
   catastrophic eruption.

   Without warning at 8:32 a.m., a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centered
   directly below the north slope triggered that part of the mountain to
   slide, approximately 7–20 seconds (about 10 seconds seems most
   reasonable) after the shock. One of the largest landslides in recorded
   history, the slide traveled at 110 to 155 miles per hour (175 to 250
   km/h) and moved across Spirit Lake's west arm; part of it hit a
   1,150-foot-high (350 m) ridge about 6 miles (9.5 km) north. Some of the
 RESPONSE: 
  The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens had a significant impact on tourism in the area. Prior to the eruption, Mount St. Helens was a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, with over 600,000 visitors per year. However, the eruption caused widespread destruction and loss of life, resulting in the death of 57 people, including innkeeper Harry Truman and geologist David A. Johnston. The eruption also caused over $1 billion in damage and scarred the mountain with a huge crater open to the north.

The eruption had a lasting impact on the tourism industry in the area. The destruction caused by the eruption made the mountain unsafe for visitors, and the area was closed to the public for several years. Even after the area was reopened, the mountain's new crater and scarred appearance made it less attractive to tourists. The loss of life and destruction caused by the eruption also had a lasting impact on the local community, with many businesses and lives disrupted or destroyed.

In the years following the eruption, efforts were made to restore the mountain and rebuild the local economy. However, the impact of the eruption on tourism was significant, and it took many years for the area to recover. Today, while Mount St. Helens is still a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, the eruption of 1980 had a lasting impact on the tourism industry in the area.

   The Ottoman Empire ( Ottoman Turkish: دولت عليه عثمانيه - Devlet-i
   Âliye-yi Osmâniyye; literally, "The Sublime Ottoman State"), also known
   in the West as the Turkish Empire, existed from AD  1299 to AD  1922.
   At the height of its power in the 16th and 17th centuries, the
   tri-continental Ottoman Empire controlled much of Southeastern Europe,
   the Middle East and North Africa, stretching from the Strait of
   Gibraltar (and in 1553 the Atlantic coast of North Africa beyond
   Gibraltar) in the west to the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf in the east,
   from the edge of Austria and Slovakia and the hinterland beyond Ukraine
   in the north to Sudan and Yemen in the south. The empire was at the
   centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six
   centuries.

   With Istanbul, (the Ottoman Turkish name of old Constantinople) as its
   capital, it was the final great Mediterranean Empire and heir to the
   legacy of Rome and Byzantium in many ways. In the 16th and 17th
   centuries, the Ottoman Empire was among the world's most powerful
   states, threatening the powers of eastern Europe with its steady
   advance through the Balkans. Its navy was a powerful force in the
   Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Indian
   Ocean. On several occasions, the Ottoman army invaded central Europe,
   laying siege to Vienna in 1529 and again in 1683 in an attempt to
   conquer the Habsburgs, and was finally repulsed only by coalitions of
   European powers on the sea and on land. It was the only Eastern power
   to seriously challenge the rising power of Western Europe between the
   15th and 20th centuries.

   The Ottoman Empire steadily declined during the 19th century, and met
   its demise at the beginning of the 20th century after its defeat in
   World War I in the Middle Eastern theatre with the other Central
   Powers. In the aftermath of the war, the Ottoman government collapsed
   and the victorious powers partitioned the Empire. Subsequent years saw
   the creation of new states from the remnants of the Empire; at present
   39 nation-states (40 including the disputed TRNC) have emerged from the
   former Ottoman territories. In Anatolia, the historical centre of the
   Empire, an emergent Turkish national movement expelled invading forces
   during the Turkish War of Independence, which concluded with the birth
   of the Republic of Turkey. The new Republic declared the Sultan and his
   family, the Ottoman Dynasty, as persona non grata of Turkey. Fifty
   years later, in 1974, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey granted
   descendants of the former dynasty the right to acquire Turkish
   citizenship.

   The history of the Ottoman Empire spans more than six centuries, and
   primary documentation of the empire's relations with other powers is to
   be found in the archives of thirty-nine nations. Earlier historiography
   of the empire was based largely on analysis of Ottoman military
   victories and defeats; current approaches take a wider perspective, the
   scope of which includes the social dynamics of territorial growth and
   dissolution, and examination of economic factors and their role in the
   empire's eventual stagnation and decline.

   An examination of Ottoman history from a political and military
   viewpoint will be presented here; a socioeconomic analysis is treated
   in separate articles, divided between two periods, the classic period
   (sometimes referred to as the "era of enlargement"), and the reform
   period (also called "the era of Westernization").

Origins

   The arpita ancestors, part of Turkic peoples, of the Ottoman Dynasty
   was part of the westward Turkic migrations from Central Asia that began
   during the 10th century. Seljuk Turks settled in Persia during this
   period. The Seljuq dynasty began to push west into Armenia and Anatolia
   at the beginning of the 11th century. These movements brought them into
   conflict with the Byzantine Empire, which had been the preeminent
   political power in the eastern Mediterranean since the Roman era, but
   had by the 11th century begun a long decline.

   Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate of the Seljuk Turks become the permanent
   foothold in Anatolia which was established a after a historic victory
   at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. Under the suzerainty of the
   Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate, the Kai tribe of Oğuz Turks created what
   eventually became known as the " Ottoman Beylik" (tr:Osmanoglu) in
   western Anatolia. The leader Ertuğrul received this land after backing
   the Seljuks in a losing border skirmish. The Seljuk system offered the
   Beylik protection from outsiders, and also allowed it to develop its
   own internal structure. The Kayı position on the far western fringe of
   the Seljuk state enabled them to build up their military power through
   co-operation with other nations living in western Anatolia, many of
   whom were Christian.

   " Ottoman Beylik" (tr:Osmanoglu) passed over to another stage,
   Anatolian Turkish Beyliks, with the demise of the Anatolian Seljuk
   Sultanate. Following the Mongol invasion of Anatolia in the 13th
   century, the sultanate collapsed and its territory was divided among a
   number of Turkish principalities known as Beylik. it became vassals of
   the Il Khanate of the Mongols.

   The name Ottoman derives from Osman I (Arabic: Uthman), son of
   Ertuğrul, who became the first Bey when he declared the independence of
   the Ottoman state in 1299. While the other Turkish Beyliks were
   preoccupied with internal conflicts, Osman was able to extend the
   frontiers of Ottoman settlement towards the edge of the Byzantine
   Empire. He moved the Ottoman capital to Bursa, and shaped the early
   political development of the nation. Given the nickname "Kara" for his
   courage, Osman I was admired as a strong and dynamic ruler long after
   his death, as evident in the centuries-old Turkish phrase, "May he be
   as good as Osman." His reputation has also been burnished by the
   medieval Turkish story known as " Osman's Dream", a foundation myth in
   which the young Osman was inspired to conquest by a prescient vision of
   empire.

   This period saw the creation of a formal Ottoman government whose
   institutions would remain largely unchanged for almost four centuries.
   In contrast to many contemporary states, the Ottoman bureaucracy tried
   to avoid military rule. The government also utilized the legal entity
   known as the millet, under which religious and ethnic minorities were
   able to manage their own affairs with substantial independence from
   central control.

   In the century after the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule began to extend
   over the Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. After defeat in Battle
   of Plocnik, the Turkish victory at the Battle of Kosovo effectively
   marked the end of Serbian power in the region, and paved the way for
   Ottoman expansion into Europe. Ottomans needed almost 100 years to
   defeat Serbia. Serbia would finally fall in 1459. With the extension of
   Turkish dominion into the Balkans, the strategic conquest of
 RESPONSE: 
  The Ottoman Empire experienced significant changes and challenges during the 19th century. Here are some key events and developments that took place during this period:

1. Decline of the Ottoman Empire: The Ottoman Empire began to decline in the 19th century due to internal conflicts, corruption, and external pressures from European powers.
2. Tanzimat Reforms: In the mid-19th century, the Ottoman government implemented a series of reforms known as the Tanzimat, which aimed to modernize the empire and address its economic and political problems.
3. Constitutional Monarchy: In 1876, the Ottoman Empire adopted a constitutional monarchy, which provided for a parliament and limited the power of the sultan.
4. Balkan Wars: In the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire faced a series of conflicts with Balkan states, including the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) and the Balkan Wars (1912-1913).
5. World War I: The Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers in 1914. The war had a devastating impact on the empire, leading to significant territorial losses and economic decline.
6. Partition of the Ottoman Empire: After World War I, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned among the victorious powers, with the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920 leading to the establishment of modern-day Turkey.

Overall, the 19th century was a period of significant change and decline for the Ottoman Empire, marked by internal conflicts, external pressures, and the gradual loss of territory and power.

   The 2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire began after a series
   of explosions early on the morning of 11 December 2005. The terminal,
   generally known as the Buncefield Depot, is an oil storage facility
   located near the M1 motorway on the edge of Hemel Hempstead in
   Hertfordshire, England. These were some of the largest explosions ever
   to occur in the country, and the incident has been described as the
   biggest of its kind in peacetime Europe. The tank fires were
   extinguished by the afternoon of 13 December 2005. However, one storage
   tank re-ignited in the evening, and the firefighters left it to burn,
   rather than attempting to re-extinguish it.

The incident

Explosion and fire

   The first and largest explosion occurred at 06:03 UTC near container
   912. From all accounts, it seems to have been an unconfined vapour
   cloud explosion. An inversion layer permitted people to hear it from a
   hundred miles (160 km) away; there are reports it was heard as far away
   as France and the Netherlands. The British Geological Survey monitored
   the event, which measured 2.4 on the Richter scale. People were woken
   in their beds even in South London. Subsequent explosions occurred at
   06:27 and 06:28. Witnesses observed flames hundreds of feet high from
   many miles away, with the smoke cloud visible from space, and as far
   north as Lincolnshire.

   Damage from the blasts, ranging from broken windows and blown-in or
   warped front doors to an entire wall being removed from a warehouse,
   occurred more than half a mile (800 m) away. Buildings in neighbouring
   St Albans also suffered: for example, Townsend School had serious blast
   damage, and a window was blown out of St Albans Abbey (both c. 5 miles
   (8 km) from the site). Several nearby office blocks were hit so badly
   that almost every window, front and back, was blown in as the explosion
   ripped through them. Had this happened during the working day, these
   offices would have been full of people; there is no doubt that this
   would have caused dozens of deaths. Reports also indicated that cars in
   nearby streets caught fire. The roof of at least one house was blown
   off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, not only
   because of the smoke and possibility of more explosions but because of
   the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.

   There were 43 reported injuries; two people were deemed to be seriously
   injured enough to be kept in hospital, one in Watford General Hospital,
   with breathing difficulties, and another in Hemel Hempstead Hospital;
   they were not in a life-threatening condition. Some early media reports
   spoke of eight fatalities, but these may have been persons missing. All
   members of staff from the terminal were accounted for.

   Hertfordshire police and fire services and the MP for the area, Mike
   Penning, have made clear that there were seven fuel tanks on the site
   which, as of 14:00 on 12 December, had not been affected; these tanks
   were at risk of exploding if the fire were to spread.

Tackling the blaze

   Around 150 firefighters began to tackle the blaze at 08:20 on the
   morning of 12 December, putting in containment measures before applying
   a large quantity of foam. Plans had been in place to start using foam
   at midnight on 11 December, but were delayed by last-minute concerns
   over possible pollution of local rivers and underlying water sources
   from contaminated water used to fight the fires. Six high volume pumps
   were used to extract 25,000 litres of water per minute from a reservoir
   2.4 kilometers from the fire, with six more high volume pumps deployed
   at various locations to serve as boosters. 32,000 litres of aerated
   foam per minute were directed against the fire for just over four
   hours, after which the pumping rate was reduced. Half the 20 individual
   fires were reported extinguished by midday. By 16:30 it was reported
   that a further two tank fires had been extinguished, but that one of
   the earlier extinguished tanks had ruptured and re-ignited, and was now
   threatening to cause the explosion of an adjacent tank. This led to the
   M1 motorway being closed again, the public exclusion area being widened
   and firefighters being temporarily withdrawn until the risk from the
   threatened tank could be determined.

   Firefighting operations were resumed at about 20:00 and it was still
   anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night.
   Further damage occurred to one of the storage tanks in the early hours
   of the morning, causing firefighters to be withdrawn once more, but
   operations resumed at 08:30. By midday on the 13 December, all but
   three fires had been extinguished, although the largest tank was still
   burning. The smoke plume had been considerably reduced and was more
   grey, indicating the amount of vapourised water now joining the smoke.
   Firefighters were confident that the remaining fires could be
   extinguished during the day. It was reported at 16:45 that all tank
   fires were now extinguished, although some smaller fires remained. 75%
   of firefighters for Hertfordshire were involved in fighting the fire,
   together with support from 16 other brigades.

   A further fire broke out during the early morning of 14 December.
   Firefighters were of the view that extinguishing it would leave the
   risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, so it would be
   better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out.

   Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that
   escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original
   explosion and fire.

   Some chemical components of firefighting foams may present considerable
   risks to water resources and various ecosystems, particularly those in
   riverine environments.

Smoke cloud

   The black smoke cloud, which was clearly visible from satellite
   photographs, drifted at high altitude (around 9,000 feet, 2750 m)
   towards Reading and Swindon, and could be seen across much of South
   East England. The small particles in the smoke, which contained
   hydrocarbons, can be an irritant but had low toxicity and were not
   expected to cause any long-term harm. The Met Office issued warnings
   that the smoke in the atmosphere could come down in rainfall during the
   night of 11 December.

   For the first two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the
   plume highly buoyant; this, together with settled weather conditions,
   allowed the plume to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing.
   When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible
   that the plume would be less buoyant and that ground-level smoke
   concentrations could then rise significantly.

   By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached
   northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the
   weekend.

   To investigate the smoke cloud the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric
   Measurements, a research aircraft operated jointly by NERC and the Met
   Office, made two flights on the 12th and 13 December. In the first
   flight the edge of the plume was followed along the south coast of
   England. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone concentrations were
   found to be low with soot particles being the major component in the
   cloud. The second flight went into the centre of the plume to obtain
   data to help forecasting and emergency teams.

Reactions and responses

Evacuations and closures

   Around 2,000 people from the Hemel Hempstead area were evacuated from
   their homes, and emergency services asked residents of the
   smoke-affected areas to close their windows and doors and stay inside.
   Hertfordshire Constabulary advised people who had houses with smashed
   windows to seek refuge with friends or family nearby if possible. Some
   people whose homes were damaged by the blast were placed in hotels,
   while others stayed in a nearby shopping centre. Total, the operator of
   the Buncefield depot, set up a helpline for people whose properties had
   been badly damaged by the explosion, and called in local authorities
   and the Salvation Army to provide accommodation or other help for those
   affected by the explosion.

   About 227 schools across Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire as well as
   libraries and other public buildings were closed on December 12 and
   December 13 for public safety. Police and local authorities advised
   residents to consult the "Hertfordshire Direct" website for up-to-date
   information. The University of Hertfordshire campus located further
   afield in Hatfield remained open. Meanwhile, 78 schools in Luton
 RESPONSE: 
  The 2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire was located near the M1 motorway in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England. The fire began after a series of explosions early on December 11, 2005, and was caused by an unconfined vapour cloud explosion. The fire was extinguished by the afternoon of December 13, but one storage tank re-ignited in the evening and was left to burn. The incident was described as the biggest of its kind in peacetime Europe, with explosions occurring at 06:03, 06:27, and 06:28 UTC. The fire was contained by 16:30 on December 12, but a further fire broke out in the early morning of December 14. The smoke cloud from the fire was visible from satellite photographs and drifted towards Reading and Swindon, with small particles containing hydrocarbons that were an irritant but had low toxicity. The Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements made two flights to investigate the smoke cloud, and evacuations and closures were put in place to ensure public safety.

   surprise joint attack by Egypt and Syria crossing the cease-fire lines
   in the Sinai and Golan Heights, respectively, which had been captured
   by Israel in 1967 during the Six-Day War.

   The Egyptians and Syrians advanced during the first 24–48 hours, after
   which momentum began to swing in Israel's favour. By the second week of
   the war, the Syrians had been pushed entirely out of the Golan Heights.
   In the Sinai to the south, the Israelis struck at the "seam" between
   two invading Egyptian armies, crossed the Suez Canal (where the old
   ceasefire line had been), and cut off an entire Egyptian army just as a
   United Nations cease-fire came into effect.

   The war had far-reaching implications for many nations. The Arab world,
   which had been humiliated by the lopsided defeat of the
   Egyptian-Syrian-Jordanian alliance during the Six-Day War, felt
   psychologically vindicated by its string of victories early in the
   conflict. This vindication paved the way for the peace process that
   followed, as well as liberalizations such as Egypt's infitah policy.
   The Camp David Accords, which came soon after, led to normalized
   relations between Egypt and Israel—the first time any Arab country had
   recognized the Israeli state. Egypt, which had already been drifting
   away from the Soviet Union, then left the Soviet sphere of influence
   almost entirely.

Background

Casus belli

   This war was part of the Arab-Israeli conflict, a conflict which has
   included many battles and wars since 1948. During the Six-Day War six
   years earlier, the Israelis had captured the Sinai clear to the Suez
   Canal, which had become the cease-fire line. The Israelis had also
   captured roughly half of the Golan Heights from Syria.

   In the years following that war, Israel erected lines of fortification
   in both the Sinai and the Golan Heights. In 1971 Israel spent $500
   million fortifying its positions on the Suez Canal, a chain of
   fortifications and gigantic earthworks known as the Bar Lev Line, named
   after Israeli General Chaim Bar-Lev.

   Nonetheless, according to Chaim Herzog,

          On June 19, 1967, the National Unity Government [of Israel]
          voted unanimously to return the Sinai to Egypt and the Golan
          Heights to Syria in return for peace agreements. The Golans
          would have to be demilitarized and special arrangement would be
          negotiated for the Straits of Tiran. The government also
          resolved to open negotiations with King Hussein of Jordan
          regarding the Eastern border.

   The Israeli decision was to be conveyed to the Arab nations by the
   United States. The US was informed of the decision, but not that it was
   to transmit it. There is no evidence of receipt from Egypt or Syria,
   who thus apparently never received the offer. The decision was kept a
   closely-guarded secret within Israeli government circles and the offer
   was withdrawn in October, 1967.

   Egypt and Syria both desired a return of the land lost in the Six-Day
   War. However, the Khartoum Arab Summit issued the "three nos,"
   resolving that there would be "no peace, no recognition and no
   negotiation with Israel."

   President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt died in September 1970. He was
   succeeded by Anwar Sadat, who resolved to fight Israel and win back the
   territory lost in the Six-Day War. In 1971, Sadat, in response to an
   initiative by UN intermediary Gunnar Jarring, declared that if Israel
   committed itself to "withdrawal of its armed forces from Sinai and the
   Gaza Strip" and to implementation of other provisions of UN Security
   Council Resolution 242 as requested by Jarring, Egypt would then "be
   ready to enter into a peace agreement with Israel." Israel responded
   that it would not withdraw to the pre- June 5, 1967 lines.

   Sadat hoped that by inflicting even a limited defeat on the Israelis,
   the status quo could be altered. Hafiz al-Assad, the head of Syria, had
   a different view. He had little interest in negotiation and felt the
   retaking of the Golan Heights would be a purely military option. Since
   the Six-Day War, Assad had launched a massive military build up and
   hoped to make Syria the dominant military power of the Arab states.
   With the aid of Egypt, Assad felt that his new army could win
   convincingly against the Israeli army and thus secure Syria's role in
   the region. Assad only saw negotiations beginning once the Golan
   Heights had been retaken by force, which would induce Israel to give up
   the West Bank and Gaza, and make other concessions.

   Sadat also had important domestic concerns in wanting war. "The three
   years since Sadat had taken office… were the most demoralized in
   Egyptian history… A desiccated economy added to the nation's
   despondency. War was a desperate option." In his biography of Sadat,
   Raphael Israeli argued that Sadat felt the root of the problem was in
   the great shame over the Six-Day War, and before any reforms could be
   introduced he felt that shame had to be overcome. Egypt's economy was
   in shambles, but Sadat knew that the deep reforms that he felt were
   needed would be deeply unpopular among parts of the population. A
   military victory would give him the popularity he needed to make
   changes. A portion of the Egyptian population, most prominently
   university students who launched wide protests, strongly desired a war
   to reclaim the Sinai and was highly upset that Sadat had not launched
   one in his first three years in office.

   The other Arab states showed much more reluctance to fully commit to a
   new war. King Hussein of Jordan feared another major loss of territory
   as had occurred in the Six-Day War, during which Jordan was halved in
   population. Sadat was also backing the claim of the PLO to the
   territories (West Bank and Gaza) and in the event of a victory promised
   Yasser Arafat that he would be given control of them. Hussein still saw
   the West Bank as part of Jordan and wanted it restored to his kingdom.
   Moreover, during the Black September crisis of 1970 a near civil war
   had broken out between the PLO and the Jordanian government. In that
 RESPONSE: 
  The Yom Kippur War, also known as the October War or the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, was fought between Israel and a coalition of Arab nations led by Egypt and Syria on October 6-26, 1973. The war began on Yom Kippur, the Jewish holiday of atonement, with a surprise joint attack by Egypt and Syria across the cease-fire lines in the Sinai and Golan Heights, respectively.

1973 oil crisis

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Recent History

   The 1973 oil crisis first began on October 17, 1973 when the
   Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OAPEC), consisting
   of the Arab members of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria, announced as a result
   of the ongoing Yom Kippur War, that they would no longer ship petroleum
   to nations that had supported Israel in its conflict with Syria and
   Egypt. This included the United States and its allies in Western
   Europe.

   About the same time, OPEC members agreed to use their leverage over the
   world price-setting mechanism for oil in order to quadruple world oil
   prices, after attempts at negotiation with the " Seven Sisters" earlier
   in the month failed. Due to the dependence of the industrialized world
   on OPEC oil, these price increases were dramatically inflationary to
   the economies of the targeted countries, while at the same time
   suppressive of economic activity. The targeted countries responded with
   a wide variety of new, and mostly permanent, initiatives to contain
   their further dependency.

Origins of the 1973 world oil shock

   The Arab-Israeli conflict triggered an energy crisis in the making.
   Before the embargo, the industrialized West, especially the United
   States, was used to cheap and plentiful petroleum. Post-World War II
   American cities, with expansive suburbs full of detached, single-family
   homes, depended on the automobile as the principal form of
   transportation — a form that consumes oil en masse as fuel. Between
   1945 and the late 1970s, the West and Japan consumed more oil and
   minerals than had been used in all previous recorded history. Oil
   consumption in the U.S. had more than doubled between 1950 and 1974.
   With only 6% of the world's population, the U.S. was consuming 33% of
   the world's energy. At the same time, the U.S. economy accounted for a
   quarter of total global production, meaning U.S. workers were over four
   times more productive than the global average. This was a result of
   their advanced industrial sector, which accounted for over five times
   the global average for energy usage.

   Oil, especially from the Middle East, was paid for in United States
   dollars (aka petrodollars), at prices fixed in dollars. U.S. President
   Richard Nixon presided over an economy in which growth was already
   sluggish, and in which inflation was already troubling. By the summer
   of 1971, Nixon was under strong public pressure to act decisively to
   end the dilemma of rising prices and general economic stagnation (see "
   stagflation"). To allow the value of gold to fall in world markets,
   Nixon ended the convertibility of the US dollar into gold on August 15,
   1971, thereby ending the Bretton Woods system, which had been in place
   since the end of World War II. The U.S. dollar was devalued by 8% in
   relation to gold in December 1971, and devalued again in 1973.

   The devaluation resulted in increased world economic and political
   uncertainty. Concurrently, in the early 1970s, the fall in the U.S.
   dollar went along with a fall in the price of oil (in USD). This
   improved the situation of U.S. industrialists in relation to European
   and Japanese competition. But the de-valorization — and then
   devaluation — of the dollar crystallized the unease of raw materials
   producers in the Third World; they saw the wealth under their lands
   being reduced and their assets growing in a currency that was worth
   significantly less than it had been recently. This set the stage for
   the struggle for control of the world's natural resources and for a
   more favorable sharing of the value of these resources between the rich
   countries and the oil-exporting nations of OPEC .

   OPEC devised a strategy of counter-penetration, whereby it hoped to
   make industrial economies that relied heavily on oil imports vulnerable
   to Third World pressures . Dwindling foreign aid from the U.S. and its
   allies, combined with the West's pro-Israeli stance in the Middle East,
   angered the Arab nations in OPEC.

Founding of OPEC

   OPEC consisted of thirteen nations, including seven Arab countries,
   Iran, and also other major petroleum-exporting countries in the
   developing world like Venezuela. It had been officially announced on
   September 14 in Cairo, 1960 to protest pressure by major oil companies
   (mostly owned by U.S., British, and Dutch nationals) to reduce oil
   prices and payments to producers. At first it had operated as an
   informal bargaining unit for the sale of oil by Third World nations. It
   confined its activities to gaining a larger share of the revenues
   produced by Western oil companies and greater control over the levels
   of production. However, in the early 1970s it began to display its
   strength.

The Yom Kippur War

   The persistence of the Arab-Israeli conflict finally triggered a
   response that transformed OPEC from a mere cartel into a formidable
   political force. After the Six Day War of 1967 the Arab members of OPEC
   formed a separate, overlapping group ( Organization of Arab Petroleum
   Exporting Countries) for the purpose of centering policy and exerting
   pressure on the West over its support of Israel. Egypt and Syria,
   though not major oil-exporting countries, joined the latter grouping to
   help articulate its objectives. Later, the Yom Kippur War of 1973
   galvanized Arab opinion. Ostensibly a reaction to the emergency
   re-supply effort that had enabled Israel to withstand Egyptian and
   Syrian forces (while at the same time the Soviets were resupplying the
   Arab forces), the Arab world imposed the 1973 oil embargo against the
   United States, Western Europe, and Japan. It has since come to light
   that an accord regarding the usage of the "oil weapon" was actually
   negotiated before the war by Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Thus by the early
   1970s the great Western oil conglomerates suddenly faced a unified bloc
   of producers.

   As mentioned, the Arab-Israeli conflict triggered a crisis already in
   the making. The West could not continue to increase its energy use 5%
   annually, pay low oil prices, yet sell inflation-priced goods to the
   petroleum producers in the Third World. This was stressed by the Shah
   of Iran, whose nation was the world's second-largest exporter of oil
   and the closest ally of the United States in the Middle East at the
   time. "Of course [the world price of oil] is going to rise," the Shah
   told the New York Times in 1973. "Certainly! And how...; You [Western
   nations] increased the price of wheat you sell us by 300%, and the same
   for sugar and cement...; You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us,
   redefined as petrochemicals, at a hundred times the price you've paid
   to us...; It's only fair that, from now on, you should pay more for
   oil. Let's say ten times more."

Arab oil embargo

   On October 16, 1973, as part of the political strategy that included
   the Yom Kippur War, OAPEC cut production of oil and placed an embargo
   on shipments of crude oil to the West, with the United States and the
   Netherlands specifically targeted. Also imposed was a boycott of
   Israel. Since oil demand is very price inelastic, (i.e., the quantity
   purchased falls little with price rises), prices had to rise
   dramatically to reduce demand to the new, lower level of supply. The
   embargo on oil caused the market price for oil to rise substantially.
   Government price controls, designed to maintain oil affordability,
   exacerbated the economic impact by creating shortages. High prices from
   the embargo were exacerbated by the shortages caused by the price
   controls, resulting in a series of recessions and high inflation that
   persisted until the early 1980's.
   The price of oil during the embargo.

   The graph to the right is based on the nominal -- not real -- price of
   oil, and so understates prices of more recent years. However, the
   effects of the Arab Oil Embargo are clear: it effectively doubled the
   real price of crude oil at the refinery level. and caused massive
   shortages in the US. This exacerbated a recession that had already
   begun, and led to a global recession through the rest of 1974.

   Over the long term, the oil embargo changed the nature of policy in the
   West toward more exploration and energy conservation. Changes also
   included a more restrictive monetary policy that was better at fighting
   inflation.

   Part of the
   2005 Atlantic hurricane season

   Hurricane Epsilon was a long lasting hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic
   hurricane season in late November and early December over the central
   Atlantic. Hurricane Epsilon was the twenty-seventh tropical or
   subtropical storm and the fifteenth hurricane of the season and was one
   of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded so late in the year.

   Hurricane Epsilon developed from an extratropical storm on November 29
   and gradually developed into a hurricane on December 2, despite a
   highly hostile environment. Epsilon then held onto hurricane status for
   several more days, frustrating the forecasters of the National
   Hurricane Centre, before finally dissipating on December 8.

Storm history

   Storm path
   Enlarge
   Storm path

   Tropical Storm Epsilon developed out of an extratropical storm in the
   central Atlantic Ocean on November 29 that had gradually gained
   tropical characteristics in the wake of Tropical Storm Delta. It was
   well east of Bermuda at the time and never would get close to land.
   Epsilon gradually strengthened into a strong tropical storm before it
   weakened slightly on December 1. The official forecasts from the
   National Hurricane Centre predicted Epsilon would weaken further in the
   highly sheared environment before becoming an extratropical system
   again. Unexpectedly, Tropical Storm Epsilon strengthened again on
   December 2 and became a hurricane over cooler waters averaging 21–24°C
   (70–75°F) and continuing shear, conditions that are highly unfavorable
   to maintaining a tropical cyclone. The official forecasts continued to
   predict weakening and eventual dissipation but Epsilon defied them and
   remained at hurricane strength for several days. At one point on
   December 4 it was thought that Epsilon had briefly weakened into a
   tropical storm, but later analysis showed that Epsilon had never
   weakened at all. Hurricane Epsilon then strengthened further to its
   peak intensity of 85 mph (135 km/h) just hours later.

   View of Hurricane Epsilon from aboard the International Space Station

   Hurricane Epsilon frustrated the forecasters, and the lack of any
   weakening led NOAA hurricane forecaster Dr. Lixion Avila to say "There
   are no clear reasons — and I am not going to make one up — to explain
   the recent strengthening of Epsilon…" The storm maintained its
   hurricane status for five days while most of the six-hourly forecasts
   during that period called for it to weaken below that intensity. Dr.
   Avila also claimed that Epsilon had developed a structure similar to
   one of an annular hurricane, which enabled it to maintain its strength
   despite poor conditions.

   On December 7 a strong upper-level flow from the northwest disrupted
   the organization of Hurricane Epsilon. The continuing shear then
   finally weakened it into a tropical storm that day. It quickly weakened
   further into a tropical depression on December 8 and dissipated shortly
   thereafter.

Impact

   As Hurricane Epsilon stayed well out to sea and never approached land,
   no warnings or watches were issued. No ships reported experiencing
   tropical storm force winds from Epsilon and there were no reports of
   damages or fatalities.

Records

   When Tropical Storm Epsilon formed on November 29, it was the first
   time that twenty-seven tropical or subtropical storms had formed in the
   Atlantic during one hurricane season. Hurricane Epsilon was only the
   sixth ever Atlantic hurricane recorded in December. Epsilon also spent
   more time as a hurricane during December than any other Atlantic storm
   (beating the old record held by Hurricane Lili of 1984).

   The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active Atlantic
   hurricane season in recorded history, shattering previous records on
   repeated occasions. The impact of the season was widespread and ruinous
   with at least 2,280 deaths and record damages of over $100 billion USD.
   Of the storms that made landfall, five of the seven major
   hurricanes—Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma—were responsible for
   most of the destruction. The Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán
   and the U.S. states of Florida and Louisiana were each struck twice by
   major hurricanes; Cuba, the Bahamas, Haiti, Mississippi, Texas, and
   Tamaulipas were each struck once and in each case brushed by at least
   one more. The most catastrophic effects of the season were felt on the
   United States' Gulf Coast, where a 30-foot (10 meter) storm surge from
   Hurricane Katrina caused devastating flooding that inundated New
   Orleans, Louisiana and destroyed most structures on the Mississippi
   coastline, and in Guatemala, where Hurricane Stan combined with an
   extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides.

   The season officially began on June 1, 2005, and lasted until November
   30, although it effectively persisted into January 2006 due to
   continued storm activity. A record twenty-eight tropical and
   subtropical storms formed, of which a record fifteen became hurricanes.
   Of these, seven strengthened into major hurricanes, a record-tying five
   became Category 4 hurricanes and a record four reached Category 5
   strength, the highest categorization for hurricanes on the
   Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Among these Category 5 storms were
   Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, the former the costliest and the latter
   the most intense Atlantic hurricane on record.

   Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season
   by noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at
   Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the
   U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA). Prior to and during the 2005 season, Dr. Gray issued four
   forecasts, each time increasing the predicted level of activity. The
   NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two
   months into the season, drastically increasing the predicted level of
   activity in the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell far
   short of the actual activity of the season.

Preseason forecasts

   On December 3, 2004, Dr. Gray's team issued its first extended-range
   forecast for the 2005 season, predicting a slightly above-average
   season. Additionally, the team predicted a greatly increased chance of
   a major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States and the
   Florida peninsula. Though the forecast predicted above-average
   activity, the level predicted was significantly less than the 2004
   season. On April 1, 2005, after confirming that El Niño conditions
   would not develop, Dr. Gray and his team revised the December forecast
   upward, expecting thirteen tropical storms instead of eleven and seven
   hurricanes instead of six. In addition, the chance of a storm impacting
   the United States was raised slightly.

   On May 16, 2005, 15 days before the season began, NOAA issued its
   outlook for the 2005 season, forecasting a 70% chance of above-normal
   activity. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) value for the season was
   predicted to be 120–190% of the median. Shortly thereafter, on May 31,
   the day before the season officially began, Dr. Gray's team revised its
   April forecast upwards to 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 4 major
   hurricanes.

Midseason outlook

   On August 2, after an extraordinarily active early season, the NOAA
   released an updated outlook on the remainder of the season,
   significantly raising the expected level of activity to numbers about
   double those of a normal season. The ACE value was now forecast to be
   180 to 270% of the median. The NOAA also noted a higher than normal
   confidence in the forecast of above-normal activity. On August 5, 2005,
   Dr. Gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated
   forecast; it was consistent with NOAA's update. Although neither the
   NOAA nor Dr. Gray had ever forecast such high levels of activity, even
   the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual level of activity.

Storms

June and July

   On June 9, nearly two months earlier than when the 2004 season started,
   Tropical Storm Arlene formed in the western Caribbean, crossing Cuba
   before making landfall on the Florida Panhandle on the 11th. Arlene
   caused only moderate damage, although one swimmer was caught in a
   riptide and drowned in Miami Beach, Florida.

   Tropical Storm Bret formed in the Bay of Campeche on June 28 and made
   landfall in Veracruz the next morning. The storm damaged hundreds of
   homes and caused flooding which killed two people.

   Hurricane Cindy formed in the Gulf of Mexico on July 4. Originally
   thought to be a tropical storm, Cindy made landfall in Louisiana on the
   5th as a minimal hurricane, dropping up to 5 inches (130 mm) of rain,
   spawning several tornadoes, and killing three people. Cindy was
   upgraded to a hurricane in the post-storm analysis.

   On July 5, Hurricane Dennis formed in the eastern Caribbean; it crossed
   Grenada before intensifying into a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest
   ever recorded in July with a pressure of 930 mbar ( hPa). Dennis struck
   Cuba at full force, then made a final landfall on the Florida
   Panhandle. The hurricane killed 89 people (mostly in Haiti) and caused
   $4–$6 billion in damages in Cuba and the United States.

   Soon thereafter, Hurricane Emily formed in the Atlantic on July 11. It
   entered the Caribbean Sea and quickly intensified to a Category 4
   storm, breaking Dennis's record for July intensity when its pressure
   reached 929 mbar (hPa). Emily then briefly reached Category 5
   intensity—the earliest such storm ever recorded in the Atlantic. Emily
   crossed the Yucatán Peninsula at Category 4 strength before hitting
   Tamaulipas at Category 3 strength. Emily killed at least 14 people over
   the course of its path. An estimated $400 million in damages have been
   reported.

   Tropical Storm Franklin formed off the Bahamas on July 18. The storm
   moved northeast and became extratropical off the coast of Atlantic
   Canada without ever having threatened land.

   Tropical Storm Gert followed soon after on July 24. Gert struck
   Veracruz near where Emily had hit a few days before; roughly 1,000
   people were evacuated for fear of flooding, but no damages or deaths
   were reported.

August

   Like July, August also got off to a fast start: Tropical Storm Harvey
   formed southwest of Bermuda on August 3. Harvey dropped some rain on
   Bermuda as it moved to the northeast; it became extratropical on August
   8 in the open Atlantic Ocean.

   The tropical depression that would become Hurricane Irene formed west
   of the Cape Verde Islands on August 4. The system moved west and north
   and did not reach hurricane strength until August 14, at which point it
   became the second Cape Verde-type hurricane of the season. Irene turned
   northeast and briefly reached Category 2 status before weakening and
   becoming extratropical on August 18. It never posed a threat to land.

   Tropical Depression Ten formed east of the Lesser Antilles on August
   13. The system dissipated the next day. Its remnants soon merged with
   another system and eventually contributed to the formation of Hurricane
   Katrina.

   Tropical Storm Jose followed, forming in the Bay of Campeche on August
   22. It strengthened rapidly but quickly reached the coast and made
   landfall in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 23, preventing
   further strengthening. Jose forced 25,000 people to evacuate their
 RESPONSE: 
  The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season affected countries in the Caribbean, Central America, Mexico, and the southeastern United States. The season began on June 1, 2005, and lasted until November 30, 2005, with a record 28 tropical storms, 15 of which became hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes.

The following countries were affected by the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season:

1. Cuba: Hurricane Dennis made landfall in Cuba on July 3, causing significant damage and flooding.
2. Haiti: Hurricane Emily made landfall in Haiti on July 17, causing widespread damage and killing at least 14 people.
3. Mexico: Hurricanes Dennis and Wilma made landfall in the Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán, causing flooding and damage.
4. United States: Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma made landfall in the Gulf Coast states of Louisiana, Texas, and Florida, causing catastrophic damage and killing hundreds of people.
5. Bahamas: Hurricane Emily made landfall in the Bahamas on July 17, causing significant damage and flooding.
6. Belize: Tropical Storm Arlene made landfall in Belize on June 11, causing minor damage.
7. Costa Rica: Tropical Storm Bret made landfall in Costa Rica on June 29, causing minor damage.
8. Nicaragua: Hurricane Felix made landfall in Nicaragua on September 11, causing significant damage and flooding.
9. Panama: Hurricane Emily made landfall in Panama on July 21, causing minor damage.

The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was one of the most active and destructive on record, with a total of 28 tropical storms, 15 of which became hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes. The season's storms caused widespread damage and flooding in the affected countries, resulting in significant loss of life and property.
