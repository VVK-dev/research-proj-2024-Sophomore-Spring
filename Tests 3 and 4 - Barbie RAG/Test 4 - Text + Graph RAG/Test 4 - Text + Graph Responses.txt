Prompt: Tell me about the Barbie movie. 
Context: On April 4, 2023, 24 character posters of the several Barbies and Kens featured in the film, tagged with brief descriptions, were shared on Barbie's social media accounts. Empire remarked: "You might have thought that Multiverse fever would be constrained generally to comic book films and never-would-have-called-it Oscar winners [Everything Everywhere All at Once]. But ... it seems Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie will also be flooding the screen with variants, this time of plastic dolls Barbie and Ken." A second teaser trailer was unveiled shortly after the posters' release, featuring a rendition of the Beach Boys' 1964 surf rock song "Fun, Fun, Fun." The Washington Post noted that the "visually striking" and "polysemic" teaser captivated multiple demographics because of its humor, color palette, and the Barbie doll's cross-generational appeal. An official trailer for the film was released on May 25, 2023. Critics noted its existential tone set against upbeat music. Ben Travis of Empire said: "There's much to discuss here—not least, that it looks visually impeccable" and speculated Academy Awards attention for its production and costume design. A float promoting the film was featured in the 2023 WeHo Pride Parade in Los Angeles; two of its LGBTQ+ cast members, Alexandra Shipp and Scott Evans, were present.Development
The idea of a live-action Barbie film was in development at Cannon Films in the mid-1980s. Renewed development on a film based on the Barbie toy line began in September 2009, when it was announced that Mattel had signed a partnership with Universal Pictures and producer Laurence Mark, but nothing came to fruition. In April 2014, Mattel teamed with Sony Pictures to produce the film, which would have Jenny Bicks writing the screenplay and Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes producing through their Parkes+MacDonald Image Nation banner. Filming was anticipated to begin by the end of the year. In March 2015, Diablo Cody was brought onto the project to rewrite the screenplay, and Amy Pascal joined the producing team. Sony ordered further rewrites by Lindsey Beer, Bert V. Royal and Hillary Winston, who submitted separate drafts.

 RESPONSE: 
The Barbie movie, directed by Greta Gerwig, features a diverse cast of Barbies and Kens in various roles, as showcased in character posters released on social media. The film explores themes of hierarchical power structures and the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken's relationship. With a production budget of $145 million, the movie received extensive marketing and promotional partnerships with brands like Airbnb, Burger King Brazil, and Xbox. It was released in theaters on July 21, 2023, with a world premiere at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. The film's soundtrack, curated by Mark Ronson, was released on August 4, 2023, and the score by Alexandre Desplat was released by WaterTower Music. Barbie's cross-generational appeal was highlighted in the teaser trailers, with an existential tone set against upbeat music. The movie became a record-breaking box office success, crossing the $1 billion mark and becoming the highest-grossing live-action comedy for Warner Bros.

Prompt: What is 'Barbenheimer'? 
Context: "Barbenheimer"
Barbie was released on the same day as Oppenheimer, a biographical film about J. Robert Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan based on the book American Prometheus, and distributed by Universal Pictures. Due to the tonal and genre contrast between the two films, many social media users created memes and ironic posts about how the two films appealed to different audiences, and how they should be viewed as a double feature. Hence, the trend was dubbed "Barbenheimer." In an interview with La Vanguardia, Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy endorsed the phenomenon, saying, "My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain." The Barbenheimer phenomenon was widely credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend (52% for Barbie) being for the two films, a total of 18.5 million people.Barbie premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, and was released in the United States on July 21. Its concurrent release with Universal Pictures' Oppenheimer was the catalyst of the "Barbenheimer" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. 
The film grossed $1.446 billion and achieved several milestones, including the highest-grossing film of 2023 and the 14th highest-grossing film of all time. Named one of the top 10 films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute, it received critical acclaim and other accolades, including eight Academy Award nominations (among them Best Picture), winning Best Original Song for "What Was I Made For?"; the song also won Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song while Barbie was awarded Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.

 RESPONSE: 
Barbenheimer is a phenomenon that emerged due to the concurrent release of the live-action Barbie movie and the biographical film Oppenheimer. It refers to the trend where audiences were encouraged to see both films as a double feature, leading to a boost in interest for both movies. The term "Barbenheimer" was coined as a result of the tonal and genre contrast between the two films and the memes and ironic posts created by social media users. Cillian Murphy, who starred in Oppenheimer, endorsed the phenomenon, suggesting that people should watch both films on the same day. This phenomenon significantly contributed to the success of both movies, with a large number of tickets sold for the double feature weekend.

Respond to the following prompt using the context given below it.
Prompt: Describe the plot of the Barbie movie to me. 
Context: Plot: Barbie ("Stereotypical Barbie") and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland, a matriarchal society populated by different versions of Barbies, Kens, and a group of discontinued models who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs in law, science, politics, and so on. 
Ken ("Beach Ken") is only happy when he is with Barbie, and seeks a closer relationship with her, but she rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships.Primarily, she began her writing by interpreting Barbie as living in a utopia and eventually experiencing reality, where she would have to "confront all the things that were shielded from them in this place [Barbieland]." She also drew parallels to the story of Adam and Eve and taking inspiration from John Milton's Paradise Lost, particularly being inspired by the concept that there is "no poetry without pain." To underscore the tragic elements of Barbie and Ken facing the real world, she focused on elements of dissonance. As such, she chose to keep a scene featuring Robbie's Barbie telling an older woman that she is beautiful after being requested to remove it, as she felt that the scene epitomized "the heart of the movie." She also desired to provide a "counterargument" to Barbie by featuring a scene in which Barbie learns that some women do not like her, and felt it gave the film "real intellectual and emotional power." As such, a scene is featured in which Barbie is being stared at inappropriately on the Venice Beach, which Gerwig chose to feature as she felt it was a universal experience, being especially relevant for actors. She was inspired by an audition she did in which she wore overalls and felt that she did not perform well in.

 RESPONSE: 
The plot of the 2023 live action Barbie movie revolves around Barbie and her fellow dolls living in Barbieland, a matriarchal society where different versions of Barbies and Kens coexist. In this society, the Kens spend their time playing at the beach while the Barbies hold prestigious jobs in various fields like law, science, and politics. However, there is a group of discontinued models who are treated as outcasts due to their unconventional traits.

Ken, known as "Beach Ken," is deeply in love with Barbie and seeks a closer relationship with her, but Barbie is more focused on other activities and her female friendships, rebuffing Ken's advances. The movie delves into themes of hierarchical power structures, exploring the negative consequences that arise within Barbieland.

As Barbie begins to experience the reality outside of the utopia of Barbieland, she must confront the challenges and complexities of the real world, including dissonance and the harsh truths that were shielded from her in her previous life. The film touches on the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken's relationship, drawing parallels to classic literature and exploring the concept of pain being intertwined with beauty and poetry.

Overall, the Barbie movie combines elements of fantasy, social commentary, and personal growth as Barbie navigates her way through a world that is far more complex and challenging than the perfect facade of Barbieland.

Prompt: Tell me about the development of the Barbie movie. 
Context: Development
The idea of a live-action Barbie film was in development at Cannon Films in the mid-1980s. Renewed development on a film based on the Barbie toy line began in September 2009, when it was announced that Mattel had signed a partnership with Universal Pictures and producer Laurence Mark, but nothing came to fruition. In April 2014, Mattel teamed with Sony Pictures to produce the film, which would have Jenny Bicks writing the screenplay and Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes producing through their Parkes+MacDonald Image Nation banner. Filming was anticipated to begin by the end of the year. In March 2015, Diablo Cody was brought onto the project to rewrite the screenplay, and Amy Pascal joined the producing team. Sony ordered further rewrites by Lindsey Beer, Bert V. Royal and Hillary Winston, who submitted separate drafts.Writing
As writers, Gerwig and Baumbach were given full creative freedom. They worked on the screenplay during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns at their house in Long Island. Baumbach felt he understood the film's purpose once Gerwig had shown him the first scene, identifying the "element" as "embracing mortality and sadness and sickness and everything that it means to be human." Gerwig was also inspired by the real-life story of Barbie creator Ruth Handler. Gerwig's film treatment consisted of an abstract poem on Barbie influenced by the Apostles' Creed. For the narrative arc, she was partially inspired by the non-fiction book Reviving Ophelia (1994) by Mary Pipher, which accounts the effects of societal pressures on American teenage girls. She also found inspiration in classic Technicolor musicals such as The Red Shoes (1948) and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964), and said: "They have such a high level of what we came to call authentic artificiality. You have a painted sky in a soundstage. Which is an illusion, but it's also really there. The painted backdrop is really there. The tangibility of the artifice is something that we kept going back to." The script also contains candid criticism of Mattel, which created skepticism among Mattel officials when they received the first version. However, Kreiz decided to trust Gerwig. Brenner noted that "being safe in this world doesn't work" as she interpreted Barbie to be a "bold" and "trailblazer" figure. As a result, Will Ferrell's portrayal as the Mattel CEO was meant to be an allegory for corporate America. Kreiz praised Ferrell and said that while Mattel officials took their brands seriously, they did not take themselves seriously. Gerwig and Robbie had felt the film was "most certainly a feminist film", but Mattel officials rejected the description. Gerwig and Robbie informed the studio that they would explore the controversies and problematic parts of Barbie, but also convinced the studio that they would respect the product.

 RESPONSE: 
The development of the live-action Barbie movie has been a long and intricate journey. It began with initial plans dating back to the mid-1980s at Cannon Films. Renewed efforts in 2009 with partnerships with Universal Pictures and later Sony Pictures led to various screenplay rewrites and changes in the production team. The final version of the movie was shaped by the creative vision of writers Gerwig and Baumbach, who were given full creative freedom to explore themes such as embracing mortality, societal pressures on teenage girls, and the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken.

The film's production involved principal photography starting in March 2022 and wrapping up in July 2022, with acclaimed cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto using filming techniques from the 1950s to capture the movie's essence. The movie's soundtrack, scored by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, was released by WaterTower Music in August 2023. The film also featured songs like "Closer To Fine" and "Push," with a notable absence of "Barbie Girl."

The Barbie movie's release was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign, including promotional partnerships with various brands like Airbnb, Burger King Brazil, and Xbox. Warner Bros. spent $150 million on the production, with a reported production budget of $145 million. The movie premiered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, before its theatrical release in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21, 2023. It went on to become the highest-grossing film of 2023, surpassing The Super Mario Bros Movie and setting records for Warner Bros as the highest-grossing film and the fastest to reach the $1 billion mark. The movie was also described as a record-breaking box office success by Warner Bros.

Gerwig and Robbie had felt the film was "most certainly a feminist film", but Mattel officials rejected the description. Gerwig and Robbie informed the studio that they would explore the controversies and problematic parts of Barbie, but also convinced the studio that they would respect the product.Primarily, she began her writing by interpreting Barbie as living in a utopia and eventually experiencing reality, where she would have to "confront all the things that were shielded from them in this place [Barbieland]." She also drew parallels to the story of Adam and Eve and taking inspiration from John Milton's Paradise Lost, particularly being inspired by the concept that there is "no poetry without pain." To underscore the tragic elements of Barbie and Ken facing the real world, she focused on elements of dissonance. As such, she chose to keep a scene featuring Robbie's Barbie telling an older woman that she is beautiful after being requested to remove it, as she felt that the scene epitomized "the heart of the movie." She also desired to provide a "counterargument" to Barbie by featuring a scene in which Barbie learns that some women do not like her, and felt it gave the film "real intellectual and emotional power." As such, a scene is featured in which Barbie is being stared at inappropriately on the Venice Beach, which Gerwig chose to feature as she felt it was a universal experience, being especially relevant for actors. She was inspired by an audition she did in which she wore overalls and felt that she did not perform well in.

 RESPONSE: 
The writing of the Barbie movie was a deeply creative and introspective process for the writers, Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. They were granted full creative freedom and worked on the screenplay during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in 2020-2021. Gerwig's initial inspiration came from the real-life story of Barbie creator Ruth Handler, and she crafted a script that delved into themes of embracing mortality, sadness, and the complexities of human existence. Drawing from sources like the Apostles' Creed, the non-fiction book "Reviving Ophelia," and classic Technicolor musicals, Gerwig aimed to create a film that explored the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken as they confront the real world.

Gerwig's approach to writing involved interpreting Barbie as initially living in a utopia and then facing the harsh realities of life outside of Barbieland. She sought to provide a counterargument to Barbie's idealized image by showcasing moments of dissonance and addressing societal pressures faced by teenage girls. The script also included candid criticism of Mattel, with Will Ferrell's portrayal of the Mattel CEO serving as an allegory for corporate America.

Despite initial skepticism from Mattel officials, Gerwig and Margot Robbie, who plays Writer Barbie in the movie, convinced the studio to trust their vision, promising to explore both the controversies and problematic aspects of Barbie while respecting the character. The writing process involved infusing the narrative with intellectual and emotional depth, highlighting universal experiences and challenging the traditional portrayal of Barbie.

Respond to the following prompt using the context given below it.
Prompt: Tell me about the set design of the Barbie movie. 
Context: Set design
Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer were the set designer and decorator, respectively, for Barbie. For the Barbie Dreamhouse, they drew inspiration from mid-century modernist architecture found in Palm Springs, including the 1946 Kaufmann Desert House by Richard Neutra, and the photography of Slim Aarons. Gerwig wanted to capture "what was so ridiculously fun about the Dreamhouses", alluding to its previous models, and referenced Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985), the paintings of Wayne Thiebaud, and the apartment of Gene Kelly's character in the Technicolor musical An American in Paris (1951). "Everything needed to be tactile, because toys are, above all, things you touch", Gerwig said of the use of practical effects instead of computer-generated imagery (CGI) to capture the sky and the San Jacinto Mountains. The set design is also noted for its extensive use of a specific shade of pink, Pantone 219. Rosco, the film's paint supplier, faced international shortages due to COVID-19-related supply-chain issues, as well as freezing temperatures that damaged stock; the film's sets required the company's entire remaining stock of pink. Because Gerwig also wanted to use practical builds,[clarification needed] and had to film sequences in miniature models, then composite the footage onto the actual image. She began discussing the production design with cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Greenwood, and costume designer Jacqueline Durran a year in advance of filming. She also called director Peter Weir for inspiration on Barbie Land, with the idea of creating it as an "interior soundstage world".Costumes
Costume designer Jacqueline Durran, who previously collaborated with Gerwig on Little Women (2019), employed a practical approach to create Barbie's wardrobe: "The defining characteristic of what she wears is where she's going and what she's doing, [i]t's about being completely dressed for your job or task." To match the film's Barbieland setting, Durran and her team created costumes made of roughly fifteen color combinations "that riffed off the idea of a French Riviera beach in the early 1960s" and drew inspiration from actress Brigitte Bardot. For Ken's outfits, Durran zeroed in a look composed of colorful sportswear from the 1980s, while actor Ryan Gosling suggested a Ken-branded underwear for the character. Durran closely adapted outfits from past iterations of Barbie dolls, such as the 1993 "Western Stampin'" dolls and the 1994 "Hot Skatin'" dolls. She noted the Barbie dolls as "a very useful way to look at different ideas of femininity: what that means, who owns it, and who it's aimed at" and reflected this idea in how she dressed the characters. While the majority of the clothing featured in the film were sourced by Durran and her team, they also pulled pieces from the fashion archives of Chanel. Ivana Primorac was the lead hair and makeup artist for the film. In 2024, Primorac and Marie Larkin and Clare Corsick jointly won the Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild Award for Best Period and/or Character Hair Styling in a Feature-Length Motion Picture for Barbie.

 RESPONSE: 
The set design of the Barbie movie was a visually stunning aspect of the film, with Sarah Greenwood as the set designer and Katie Spencer as the decorator. Drawing inspiration from mid-century modernist architecture in Palm Springs, particularly the Kaufmann Desert House by Richard Neutra, the sets for the Barbie Dreamhouse captured the essence of fun and nostalgia associated with Barbie's world. The design team referenced various sources such as Slim Aarons' photography, Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Wayne Thiebaud's paintings, and the apartment of Gene Kelly's character in An American in Paris to create a tactile and vibrant environment.

The use of practical effects instead of CGI added to the authenticity of the sets, including capturing the sky and the San Jacinto Mountains. A specific shade of pink, Pantone 219, was extensively used throughout the film, with Rosco facing challenges due to supply shortages and weather conditions. Director Greta Gerwig collaborated closely with the production team, including cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, to bring Barbie Land to life as an "interior soundstage world."

Overall, the set design of the Barbie movie not only paid homage to Barbie's iconic Dreamhouse but also infused it with a modern and visually captivating aesthetic that complemented the film's themes and characters.

Respond to the following prompt using the context given below it.
Prompt: Tell me about the music of the Barbie movie. 
Context: Ronson was also tasked with curating a compilation soundtrack that matched Gerwig's vision for Barbie. As the film was being edited, Ronson and Gerwig showed some of its scenes to artists they wanted on the soundtrack. The soundtrack, Barbie the Album, was released on July 21, 2023, and features music by Ava Max, Charli XCX, Dominic Fike, Fifty Fifty, Gayle, Haim, Ice Spice, Kali, Karol G, Khalid, Sam Smith, Lizzo, Nicki Minaj, Billie Eilish, Pink Pantheress, Tame Impala, the Kid Laroi, and cast members Ryan Gosling and Dua Lipa. "Dance the Night" by Dua Lipa was released as the album's lead single on May 26, 2023. It was followed by "Watati" by Karol G on June 2, 2023. "Angel" by Pink Pantheress was released on June 9, 2023, as the first promotional single. "Barbie World" by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice was released as the album's third single on June 23, 2023. The album's second promotional single, "Speed Drive" by Charli XCX was released on June 30, 2023. On July 6, 2023, the album's third and final promotional single, "Barbie Dreams" by Fifty Fifty and Kaliii was released. On July 10, 2023, Warner Bros. released a preview clip of Ryan Gosling singing "I'm Just Ken." The album's fourth single, "What Was I Made For?" by Billie Eilish, was released on July 13, 2023.On April 4, 2023, 24 character posters of the several Barbies and Kens featured in the film, tagged with brief descriptions, were shared on Barbie's social media accounts. Empire remarked: "You might have thought that Multiverse fever would be constrained generally to comic book films and never-would-have-called-it Oscar winners [Everything Everywhere All at Once]. But ... it seems Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie will also be flooding the screen with variants, this time of plastic dolls Barbie and Ken." A second teaser trailer was unveiled shortly after the posters' release, featuring a rendition of the Beach Boys' 1964 surf rock song "Fun, Fun, Fun." The Washington Post noted that the "visually striking" and "polysemic" teaser captivated multiple demographics because of its humor, color palette, and the Barbie doll's cross-generational appeal. An official trailer for the film was released on May 25, 2023. Critics noted its existential tone set against upbeat music. Ben Travis of Empire said: "There's much to discuss here—not least, that it looks visually impeccable" and speculated Academy Awards attention for its production and costume design. A float promoting the film was featured in the 2023 WeHo Pride Parade in Los Angeles; two of its LGBTQ+ cast members, Alexandra Shipp and Scott Evans, were present.

It earned $70.5 million on its opening day, which included $22.3 million from Wednesday and Thursday night previews, both of which were the best of 2023. Barbie's opening weekend gross of $162 million marked the largest opening since Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ($181.3 million in November 2022). It was also the biggest opening ever for a film helmed by a female director, besting Captain Marvel (2019), and surpassed Suicide Squad (2016) to have Robbie's highest opening weekend, as well as Blade Runner 2049 (2017) to have Gosling's largest opening weekend. It scored the third-highest July opening weekend at the time, behind The Lion King (2019) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2.[250] This also marked the third-highest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film, after the latter film and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016).

PROMPT: 
Respond to the following prompt using the context given below it.
Prompt: Tell me about the themes the Barbie movie explores. 
Context: Themes and analysis
Philosophy
Barbie has been characterized as exploring themes of existentialism. Lucy Ford of GQ wrote that the film "ruminates on the very idea of what makes us human, the idea of 'the other', whether there's truly such a thing as autonomy or if we're all simply pawns to be picked up and disposed of when we are no longer useful." Ford observed that, in the film, Barbie and Ken go on "opposite but equal" journeys of self-discovery, after venturing out into the Real World and learning that it is an oppressive patriarchal society as opposed to the matriarchal utopia that is Barbieland, and get "caught in the crosshairs of being both sentient and someone else's idea, battling with free will and the omnipresent predetermined rules about where to go and how to act." In Clark University, Professor of Philosophy Wiebke Deimling compared a scene in the film, in which Barbie has to make a choice between going back to her perfect life in Barbieland or learning the truth about her existence in the Real World, to the experience machine, a thought experiment by American philosopher Robert Nozick. Diemling also observed that gender in Barbieland is performative, noting how the Kens behave before and after a patriarchy is established. Alissa Wilkinson of Vox compared Barbieland to the biblical Garden of Eden, with Barbie and Ken as inverted parallels of Adam and Eve. She saw Barbie and Ken's first impression "that they're suddenly self-conscious and aware of being looked at" in the Real World as the film's version of the Fall. Chinese film critic Li Jingfei (李竞菲) compared Barbie's sudden awareness of death to the moment when Siddhārtha Gautama left the palace of his birth and first learned of suffering and death, which eventually led to his enlightenment.Primarily, she began her writing by interpreting Barbie as living in a utopia and eventually experiencing reality, where she would have to "confront all the things that were shielded from them in this place [Barbieland]." She also drew parallels to the story of Adam and Eve and taking inspiration from John Milton's Paradise Lost, particularly being inspired by the concept that there is "no poetry without pain." To underscore the tragic elements of Barbie and Ken facing the real world, she focused on elements of dissonance. As such, she chose to keep a scene featuring Robbie's Barbie telling an older woman that she is beautiful after being requested to remove it, as she felt that the scene epitomized "the heart of the movie." She also desired to provide a "counterargument" to Barbie by featuring a scene in which Barbie learns that some women do not like her, and felt it gave the film "real intellectual and emotional power." As such, a scene is featured in which Barbie is being stared at inappropriately on the Venice Beach, which Gerwig chose to feature as she felt it was a universal experience, being especially relevant for actors. She was inspired by an audition she did in which she wore overalls and felt that she did not perform well in.

 RESPONSE: 
The Barbie movie explores themes of existentialism, hierarchical power structures, and the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken's journey. It delves into the idea of what makes us human, autonomy, free will, and the struggle between predetermined rules and individual agency. The film contrasts Barbieland's utopia with the oppressive patriarchal society of the Real World, prompting Barbie and Ken to embark on journeys of self-discovery. Gender in Barbieland is portrayed as performative, with Barbie and Ken's experiences paralleling themes from philosophical and religious narratives such as the Garden of Eden and the concept of enlightenment through confronting suffering and death. The movie challenges the characters to confront realities shielded from them, face dissonance, and navigate through a world where they are both sentient beings and products of someone else's ideas. These themes add depth and complexity to the narrative, inviting viewers to contemplate existential questions and societal structures.

Prompt: What did journalists from the New York Times say about the Barbie movie? 
Context: Critical response
Barbie attained critical acclaim. According to The New York Times, critics praised the script for addressing past criticisms of the Barbie brand's portrayal of women and lack of diversity while infusing humor, but there were also critics who felt that it did not go far enough in critiquing consumerism and beauty standards. The performances of Robbie and Gosling received widespread acclaim.[290]In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw awarded Barbie a three out of five stars, describing it as "beamingly affectionate and deliriously pink-themed" but "perhaps a giant two-hour commercial for a product" and highlighted Gosling as a scene-stealer, being given "all the best lines." In India Currents, Amann Mahajan notes, "Perhaps the most impactful ... moment[] is one in which Barbie is calmly eviscerated by a teenage girl who dubs her a 'fascist.' [I]t's this scene (though not that particular comment) which comes closest to actually critiquing Barbie's legacy. ... And that's just it: the movie is hemmed in by the fact that it is, at the end of the day, produced by Mattel."

Prompt: How did Mattel influence the development of the Barbie movie? 
Context: Development
The idea of a live-action Barbie film was in development at Cannon Films in the mid-1980s. Renewed development on a film based on the Barbie toy line began in September 2009, when it was announced that Mattel had signed a partnership with Universal Pictures and producer Laurence Mark, but nothing came to fruition. In April 2014, Mattel teamed with Sony Pictures to produce the film, which would have Jenny Bicks writing the screenplay and Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes producing through their Parkes+MacDonald Image Nation banner. Filming was anticipated to begin by the end of the year. In March 2015, Diablo Cody was brought onto the project to rewrite the screenplay, and Amy Pascal joined the producing team. Sony ordered further rewrites by Lindsey Beer, Bert V. Royal and Hillary Winston, who submitted separate drafts.Marketing
Barbie received an extensive marketing campaign. In the months leading up to its release, Mattel entered into several Barbie-themed promotional partnerships and collaborations with various brands, including Airbnb, Aldo Group, Bloomingdale's, Burger King Brazil, Chi Haircare, Forever 21, Gap Inc., Hot Topic, Krispy Kreme Philippines, Primark, Progressive Insurance, Spirit Halloween, Ulta, and Xbox. Studio parent company Warner Bros. Discovery also engaged in cross-promotion through its TV channels, most prominently with an HGTV renovation reality competition series, Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge, coproduced by Mattel Television, which premiered shortly before the film's release. Trade publication Variety reported that Warner Bros. spent $150 million promoting Barbie—more than the $145 million budget used to produce the film itself.

 RESPONSE: 
Mattel influenced the development of the Barbie movie by actively partnering with major film studios like Sony Pictures and Universal Pictures to bring the project to life. They collaborated with various producers such as Laurence Mark and engaged in multiple rounds of screenplay rewrites to ensure the film's success. Despite facing skepticism and rejection of certain feminist film descriptions, Mattel remained dedicated to the project, ultimately playing a significant role in shaping the direction of the live-action Barbie movie.

She was inspired by an audition she did in which she wore overalls and felt that she did not perform well in.One evening at a dance party, Barbie is suddenly stricken with worries about mortality. Overnight, she develops bad breath, cellulite, and flat feet, disrupting her usual routines and the classic perfection of the Barbies. 
Weird Barbie, a disfigured doll, tells Barbie to find the child playing with her in the real world to cure her afflictions. Barbie decides to follow the advice and travel to the real world, with Ken joining Barbie by stowing away in her convertible.

 RESPONSE: 
In the Barbie movie, the main character undergoes a significant transformation as she transitions from her idealized life in Barbieland to facing the realities of the real world. Initially shielded from certain aspects of life, Barbie is forced to confront challenges and dissonance, symbolized by her sudden afflictions like bad breath, cellulite, and flat feet. This disruption to her perfect image leads her to seek a cure in the real world, ultimately deciding to embark on a journey with Ken.

Throughout the film, Barbie's character evolves as she grapples with mortality, imperfections, and the complexities of the world outside Barbieland. This journey represents a shift from a utopian existence to a more grounded and authentic experience, where she learns about herself and others. The scenes featuring Barbie's interactions with different characters and her realization that not everyone may like her contribute to her growth and understanding of the world around her.

Overall, Barbie's transformation in the movie reflects a deeper exploration of themes such as the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken's relationship, the challenges of hierarchical power structures, and the idea that true poetry can only exist alongside pain. Through these experiences, Barbie evolves from a perfect doll to a more nuanced and relatable character, showcasing her resilience and ability to adapt to new circumstances.

PROMPT: 
Respond to the following prompt using the context given below it.
Prompt: How did Sony Pictures influence the development of the Barbie movie? 
Context: Development
The idea of a live-action Barbie film was in development at Cannon Films in the mid-1980s. Renewed development on a film based on the Barbie toy line began in September 2009, when it was announced that Mattel had signed a partnership with Universal Pictures and producer Laurence Mark, but nothing came to fruition. In April 2014, Mattel teamed with Sony Pictures to produce the film, which would have Jenny Bicks writing the screenplay and Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes producing through their Parkes+MacDonald Image Nation banner. Filming was anticipated to begin by the end of the year. In March 2015, Diablo Cody was brought onto the project to rewrite the screenplay, and Amy Pascal joined the producing team. Sony ordered further rewrites by Lindsey Beer, Bert V. Royal and Hillary Winston, who submitted separate drafts.Set design
Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer were the set designer and decorator, respectively, for Barbie. For the Barbie Dreamhouse, they drew inspiration from mid-century modernist architecture found in Palm Springs, including the 1946 Kaufmann Desert House by Richard Neutra, and the photography of Slim Aarons. Gerwig wanted to capture "what was so ridiculously fun about the Dreamhouses", alluding to its previous models, and referenced Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985), the paintings of Wayne Thiebaud, and the apartment of Gene Kelly's character in the Technicolor musical An American in Paris (1951). "Everything needed to be tactile, because toys are, above all, things you touch", Gerwig said of the use of practical effects instead of computer-generated imagery (CGI) to capture the sky and the San Jacinto Mountains. The set design is also noted for its extensive use of a specific shade of pink, Pantone 219. Rosco, the film's paint supplier, faced international shortages due to COVID-19-related supply-chain issues, as well as freezing temperatures that damaged stock; the film's sets required the company's entire remaining stock of pink. Because Gerwig also wanted to use practical builds,[clarification needed] and had to film sequences in miniature models, then composite the footage onto the actual image. She began discussing the production design with cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Greenwood, and costume designer Jacqueline Durran a year in advance of filming. She also called director Peter Weir for inspiration on Barbie Land, with the idea of creating it as an "interior soundstage world".

 RESPONSE: 
Sony Pictures influenced the development of the Barbie movie by partnering with Mattel in April 2014 to produce the film. They brought on various writers and producers to work on the project, including Jenny Bicks, Laurie MacDonald, Walter F. Parkes, Diablo Cody, and Amy Pascal. Sony Pictures also ordered rewrites by Lindsey Beer, Bert V. Royal, and Hillary Winston to refine the screenplay. Additionally, Sony Pictures played a crucial role in the set design process, with Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer creating the visually stunning Barbie Dreamhouse inspired by mid-century modernist architecture and practical effects instead of CGI. Sony Pictures' involvement helped shape the creative direction and production of the Barbie movie, contributing to its overall vision and execution.

Prompt: List all the things Greta Gerwig describes as influences for the story and development of the movie. 
Context: Writing
As writers, Gerwig and Baumbach were given full creative freedom. They worked on the screenplay during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns at their house in Long Island. Baumbach felt he understood the film's purpose once Gerwig had shown him the first scene, identifying the "element" as "embracing mortality and sadness and sickness and everything that it means to be human." Gerwig was also inspired by the real-life story of Barbie creator Ruth Handler. Gerwig's film treatment consisted of an abstract poem on Barbie influenced by the Apostles' Creed. For the narrative arc, she was partially inspired by the non-fiction book Reviving Ophelia (1994) by Mary Pipher, which accounts the effects of societal pressures on American teenage girls. She also found inspiration in classic Technicolor musicals such as The Red Shoes (1948) and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964), and said: "They have such a high level of what we came to call authentic artificiality. You have a painted sky in a soundstage. Which is an illusion, but it's also really there. The painted backdrop is really there. The tangibility of the artifice is something that we kept going back to." The script also contains candid criticism of Mattel, which created skepticism among Mattel officials when they received the first version. However, Kreiz decided to trust Gerwig. Brenner noted that "being safe in this world doesn't work" as she interpreted Barbie to be a "bold" and "trailblazer" figure. As a result, Will Ferrell's portrayal as the Mattel CEO was meant to be an allegory for corporate America. Kreiz praised Ferrell and said that while Mattel officials took their brands seriously, they did not take themselves seriously. Gerwig and Robbie had felt the film was "most certainly a feminist film", but Mattel officials rejected the description. Gerwig and Robbie informed the studio that they would explore the controversies and problematic parts of Barbie, but also convinced the studio that they would respect the product.Gerwig was also influenced by her childhood experiences with Barbie. Her mother discouraged her from purchasing such dolls, but eventually allowed her to. Opting to acknowledge the controversial nature of the Barbie doll, Gerwig chose to create a film where she would be both "doing the thing and subverting the thing", in the sense that she would be celebrating the feminism behind Barbie while also noting the controversial beauty standards associated with it. She was also fascinated by the idea that humans created dolls, which in turn imitate humans, feeling that "we're in constant conversation with inanimate objects" while also conveying an affirmative message to the audience to "just be yourself and know that that's enough." The film deliberately juxtaposed contradictory messaging, such as critiquing consumerism yet glamorizing plastic products; and in the film's ending, where Barbie desires to be more than just a plastic doll. Gerwig made the film as an "earnest attempt to make amends" between affirming womens' worth and conveying the impossibility of perfection, which some perceived to be standards associated with Barbie.

Prompt: Which countries took action on the movie, regarding the nine dash line controversy? 
Context: The controversy over the alleged appearance of the nine-dash line (a depiction of the South China Sea from Chinese perspective) in the film began when Vietnam's film censorship authority banned the film for allegedly displaying such lines. In contrast, the counterpart from the Philippines requested that the lines in question be blurred. Both countries have banned the films Abominable (2019) and Uncharted (2022) for featuring the actual nine-dash line. The nine-dash line is controversial due to maritime border disputes between China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines.Censorship

Prompt: What did media outlets and newspapers say about the Barbie movie? 
Context: Critical response
Barbie attained critical acclaim. According to The New York Times, critics praised the script for addressing past criticisms of the Barbie brand's portrayal of women and lack of diversity while infusing humor, but there were also critics who felt that it did not go far enough in critiquing consumerism and beauty standards. The performances of Robbie and Gosling received widespread acclaim.[290]In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw awarded Barbie a three out of five stars, describing it as "beamingly affectionate and deliriously pink-themed" but "perhaps a giant two-hour commercial for a product" and highlighted Gosling as a scene-stealer, being given "all the best lines." In India Currents, Amann Mahajan notes, "Perhaps the most impactful ... moment[] is one in which Barbie is calmly eviscerated by a teenage girl who dubs her a 'fascist.' [I]t's this scene (though not that particular comment) which comes closest to actually critiquing Barbie's legacy. ... And that's just it: the movie is hemmed in by the fact that it is, at the end of the day, produced by Mattel."

Prompt: What other Warner Bros. films did Barbie surpass in earnings? 
Context: Other territories
Outside of the United States and Canada, Barbie earned $194.3 million from 69 offshore markets in its opening weekend. Of the 69 markets, it was the number one film for the weekend in 58, scored the largest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film in 26 and marked the largest opening for a 2023 film in 24. In the United Kingdom, the film opened with $24.2 million, which was the year's largest opening. In France, it opened with $10.2 million, marking the largest debut for a Warner Bros. film since Joker (2019). The following weekend, Barbie earned $127 million, dropping by just 31%. It remained the number one film of the weekend in 57 markets. Within its sophomore weekend, it became the highest-grossing film of 2023 in Brazil, as well as the highest-grossing Warner Bros. release ever. In Australia, the film scored the largest second week ever, for a running total of $30.6 million after two weekends. In the UK, Barbie began outpacing the ten-day total of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, Warner Bros.' highest-grossing film in the country, in its second weekend.[266] In its third weekend, Barbie grossed $74 million from 69 markets for a drop of 41%. As of September 9, 2023, the highest-grossing overseas markets were the United Kingdom ($120.8 million), Germany ($56.5 million) Australia ($55.6 million), Mexico ($54.3 million) and France ($47.6 million). In Ireland, Barbie became the highest-grossing film in history with $9.57 million, surpassing Avatar (2009).It was described as a "record-breaking" box office success during its opening weekend, and set the record for any film that was not a sequel, remake, or superhero property. Barbie became the highest-grossing live-action comedy film of all time, smashing the domestic record formerly held by Home Alone (1990) and the worldwide record formerly held by The Hangover Part II (2011) simultaneously. It has also become Gerwig's highest-grossing film, overtaking its predecessor Little Women (2019).The film crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide on August 6, 2023, making it the first film by a solo female director to do so. This was also the fastest Warner Bros. film to reach $1 billion, beating Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011). In late August, Barbie surpassed that same film again, becoming Warner Bros.'s highest-grossing film, not adjusted for inflation.[241] By September 2, the film surpassed $1.365 billion at the global box office, replacing The Super Mario Bros. Movie as the highest-grossing film of the year. Additionally, it became the highest-grossing film by a solo female director, surpassing the previous record held by Jia Ling for Hi, Mom (2021).

PROMPT: 
Respond to the following prompt using the context given below it.
Prompt: How does the character of 'Beach Ken' change over the course of the movie? 
Context: Megan Garber of The Atlantic found that Ken and his journey of self-discovery "mimics adolescence", writing: "Like any teenager, Ken is figuring out who he is, and trying the world's possibilities on for size. But his immaturity is not contained, and this is its problem. His adolescent approach to the world, instead, inflicts itself on everyone else." Garber concluded that Ken embodies a "core idea" in the film "that patriarchy is a profound form of immaturity." Eliana Dockterman of Time noted that Ken's radicalization resembles the men's rights movement, particularly in his "feelings of emasculation", male fragility and evangelization of the patriarchy.Plot: Barbie ("Stereotypical Barbie") and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland, a matriarchal society populated by different versions of Barbies, Kens, and a group of discontinued models who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs in law, science, politics, and so on. 
Ken ("Beach Ken") is only happy when he is with Barbie, and seeks a closer relationship with her, but she rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships.

 RESPONSE: 
In the 2023 live action Barbie movie, the character of 'Beach Ken' undergoes a significant transformation throughout the story. Initially portrayed as a carefree and somewhat immature individual who spends his days playing at the beach and seeking a closer relationship with Barbie, Beach Ken's journey of self-discovery mirrors that of adolescence. As the plot unfolds, Beach Ken's immaturity and adolescent approach to the world begin to impact those around him, reflecting a deeper theme in the film that patriarchy is rooted in immaturity.

As Beach Ken grapples with his feelings of emasculation and male fragility, his radicalization towards the men's rights movement becomes more pronounced. His evangelization of the patriarchy and struggles with his own identity lead to conflicts within Barbieland, particularly with the empowered Barbies who hold prestigious jobs in various fields.

Ultimately, Beach Ken's character arc highlights the complexities of masculinity, power dynamics, and the consequences of clinging to outdated gender norms. Through his journey, the film delves into themes of self-discovery, societal expectations, and the impact of toxic masculinity on individuals and society as a whole.
