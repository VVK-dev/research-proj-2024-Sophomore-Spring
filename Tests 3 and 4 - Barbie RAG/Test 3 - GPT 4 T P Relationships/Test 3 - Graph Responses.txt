 RESPONSE: 
The music of the 2023 live action Barbie movie features a diverse soundtrack curated by composer Mark Ronson. Songs like "Closer To Fine" and "Push" are included in the movie, while iconic tracks like "Barbie Girl" are notably absent. Alexandre Desplat was initially set to score the film, but Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt assumed scoring duties. The score was released by WaterTower Music on August 4, 2023, adding to the overall experience of the record-breaking box office success described by Warner Bros. The music complements the themes explored in the movie, such as the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken's characters and the negative consequences of hierarchical power structures.

 RESPONSE: 
The Barbie movie was received exceptionally well at the box office. It became the highest-grossing film of the year 2023, surpassing even "The Super Mario Bros Movie." The movie also set records by becoming Warner Bros' highest-grossing film, crossing the 1 billion mark in revenue, and being the fastest Warner Bros film to reach that milestone. Additionally, it was the first film by a solo female director to achieve such a feat. Despite being overtaken by "Little Women" later on, the Barbie movie was described as a record-breaking box office success and was hailed as the highest-grossing live-action comedy film.

 RESPONSE: 
Media outlets and newspapers praised the Barbie movie for its exploration of hierarchical power structures and the negative consequences they can bring. The film, which began development in April 2014, delves into the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken's characters, shedding light on deeper themes. With principal photography starting on March 22, 2022, and wrapping up on July 21, 2022, the movie utilized filming techniques from the 1950s, giving it a unique visual style. The score, curated by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, was released on August 4, 2023, by WaterTower Music. The promotional partnerships with various brands like Airbnb, Burger King Brazil, and Xbox, along with a reported promotion budget by Variety, contributed to the film's success. The Barbie movie premiered in Los Angeles on July 9, 2023, and went on to become a record-breaking box office success, grossing over 1 billion dollars worldwide and earning the title of the highest-grossing live-action comedy of all time.
